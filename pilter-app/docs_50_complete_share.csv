27989839,Cilostazol and enzymatically modified isoquercitrin attenuate experimental colitis and colon cancer in mice by inhibiting cell proliferation and inflammation.,"We previously reported the anti-inflammatory effects of cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 3, and two antioxidants, enzymatically modified isoquercitrin and √é¬±-lipoic acid in a dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis mouse model. We further examined the chemopreventive effects of these substances in a murine azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulphate -induced colorectal carcinoma model and compared the effects with those of the well-known anticancer natural plant pigment, anthocyanin. In addition, the effects on cell proliferation activity were evaluated in colon cancer cell lines and mucosal epithelial cells in a model of acute dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis. Cilostazol and enzymatically modified isoquercitrin improved the outcome of azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulphate-induced colorectal cancer along with anthocyanin though inhibiting inflammation and cell proliferation, but the effect of √é¬±-lipoic acid was minimal. Inhibition of cell proliferation by cilostazol was confirmed in√Ç vitro. In the acute dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis model, cilostazol and enzymatically modified isoquercitrin prevented the decrease in epithelial proliferative cells. These results indicate that cilostazol and enzymatically modified isoquercitrin first exhibited an anti-dextran sodium sulphate effect at the initial stage of colitis and then showed antitumour effects throughout subsequent inflammation-related cancer developmental stages.",include,cilostazol,colorectal cancer,In Vitro,Effective
26878064,Zinc Ionophore (Clioquinol) Inhibition of Human ZIP1-Deficient Prostate Tumor Growth in the Mouse Ectopic Xenograft Model: A Zinc Approach for the Efficacious Treatment of Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths in males. This is mainly due to the absence of an available efficacious chemotherapy despite decades of research in pursuit of effective treatment approaches. A plausible target for the treatment is the established clinical relationship that the zinc levels in the malignant cells are markedly decreased compared to the normal epithelium in virtually all cases of prostate cancer, and at all stages malignancy. The decrease in zinc results from the downregulation of the functional zinc uptake transporter, ZIP1; which occurs during early development of prostate malignancy. This is an essential requirement for the development of malignancy to prevent the cytotoxic/tumor-suppressor effects of increased zinc on the premalignant and malignant cells. Thus prostate cancer is a ZIP1-deficient malignancy. This relationship provides the basis for a treatment regimen that will facilitate the uptake and accumulation of zinc into the premalignant and malignant cells. In this report we employed a zinc ionophore (clioquinol) approach in the treatment of mice with human ZIP1-deficient prostate tumors (ectopic xenograft model). Clioquinol treatment resulted in 85%inhibition of tumor growth due to the cytotoxic effects of zinc. Coupled with additional results from earlier studies, the compelling evidence provides a plausible approach for the effective treatment of human prostate cancer; including primary site malignancy, hormone-resistant cancer, and metastasis. Additionally, this approach might be effective in preventing the development of malignancy in individuals suspected of presenting with early development of malignancy. Clinical trials are now required in leading to the potential for an efficacious zinc-treatment approach, which is urgently needed for the treatment of prostate cancer.",include,clioquinol,prostate cancer,In Vivo,Effective
20798593,Use of dabigatran etexilate to reduce breast cancer progression.,"Coagulation proteases and the generation of thrombin are increased in breast tumor epithelial and stromal cells. Since thrombin can modify tumor cell behavior directly through the activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs) or indirectly by generating fibrin matrices, the effect of dabigatran etexilate, a direct thrombin inhibitor, on breast cancer development was evaluated. Dabigatran inhibited invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells across Matrigel-coated membranes at concentrations that had no effect on the proliferation index of cultured tumor cells. In vivo evaluation of invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells in tracheal xenotransplants in nude mice orally administered dabigatran etexilate twice daily at a dose of 45 mg/kg over 4 weeks demonstrated less invasion of tumor cells through the tracheal wall compared to vehicle-treated mice. To evaluate the effect of dabigatran on the development of metastatic foci, 4T1 tumor cells were injected orthotopically in the mammary fat pads of syngeneic Balb/c mice. Dabigatran etexilate treatment exhibited evidence of antitumor activity with a 50% reduction in tumor volume at 4 weeks following orthotopic injection of 4T1 cells in syngeneic Balb/c mice with no weight loss in treated mice. Dabigatran etexilate reduced both 4T1 tumor cells in the blood and liver micrometastases by 50-60%. These results suggest that oral administration of the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran etexilate, inhibits both invasion and metastasis of malignant breast tumors, suggesting that it may be beneficial in not only preventing thrombotic events in cancer patients, but also as adjunct therapy to treat malignant tumors.",include,dabigatran etexilate,breast cancer,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
30685222,A study in a rat initiation-promotion bladder tumour model demonstrated no promoter/progressor potential of dapagliflozin.,"Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, is indicated to improve glycaemic control in adults of type 2 diabetes. In nonclinical studies, dapagliflozin was neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic. However, in some clinical studies, an increased incidence of bladder cancer was observed in the dapagliflozin group vs. the placebo. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine if dapagliflozin can act as a promoter in a 2-stage bladder cancer model in rats induced with N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN). Rats given BBN (100 or 400√¢‚Ç¨¬Ømg/kg, po) twice weekly for 6 weeks in Phase 1 were assigned in Phase 2 to receive daily dose of vehicle, dapagliflozin (0.5√¢‚Ç¨¬Ømg/kg, po) or uracil (positive control, 3% in diet) from weeks 8-34. All bladders were evaluated by histopathology. Verifying the validity of the model, uracil increased the incidence of bladder cancer, while dapagliflozin had no effect on the incidence or invasiveness of transitional cell carcinoma. The exposure of dapagliflozin at 0.5√¢‚Ç¨¬Ømg/kg/day in rats was 7 times the clinical exposure at maximal therapeutic dose (10√¢‚Ç¨¬Ømg). In conclusion, dapagliflozin does not act as promoter or progressor of bladder cancer in a validated bladder cancer model in rats.",include,dapagliflozin,bladder cancer,In Vivo,No effect
23074173,"The iron chelator, deferasirox, as a novel strategy for cancer treatment: oral activity against human lung tumor xenografts and molecular mechanism of action.","Deferasirox is an orally effective iron (Fe) chelator currently used for the treatment of iron-overload disease and has been implemented as an alternative to the gold standard chelator, desferrioxamine (DFO). Earlier studies demonstrated that DFO exhibits anticancer activity due to its ability to deplete cancer cells of iron. In this investigation, we examined the in vitro and in vivo activity of deferasirox against cells from human solid tumors. To date, there have been no studies to investigate the effect of deferasirox on these types of tumors in vivo. Deferasirox demonstrated similar activity at inhibiting proliferation of DMS-53 lung carcinoma and SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cell lines compared with DFO. Furthermore, deferasirox was generally similar or slightly more effective than DFO at mobilizing cellular (59)Fe and inhibiting iron uptake from human transferrin depending on the cell type. However, deferasirox potently inhibited DMS-53 xenograft growth in nude mice when given by oral gavage, with no marked alterations in normal tissue histology. To understand the antitumor activity of deferasirox, we investigated its effect on the expression of molecules that play key roles in metastasis, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. We demonstrated that deferasirox increased expression of the metastasis suppressor protein N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 and upregulated the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1) while decreasing cyclin D1 levels. Moreover, this agent increased the expression of apoptosis markers, including cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1. Collectively, we demonstrate that deferasirox is an orally effective antitumor agent against solid tumors.",include,deferasirox,lung carcinoma,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
15517894,High efficacy of docetaxel with and without androgen deprivation and estramustine in preclinical models of advanced prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: To assess the activity of docetaxel in combination with hormonal therapy in preclinical models of prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since prostate cancer has a predilection for the bone, we assessed the antitumor activity of docetaxel in in vivo models of both bone metastasis and localized prostate cancer, using MDA PCa 2b and PC3 cells in SCID mice. RESULTS: Dramatic antitumor efficacy was observed regardless of whether the tumor cells were implanted in the prostate or in the bone. Antitumor activity was also evident in both osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions. Reasoning that docetaxel efficacy might be enhanced if it were to be used earlier in the course of the disease, we studied the sequence of docetaxel and androgen ablation (part of standard treatment for early-stage prostate cancer) in the MDA PCa 2b xenograft model. The activity was similar whether docetaxel and androgen ablation were used alone, simultaneously, or in sequence, indicating a lack of synergism or antagonism. Finally, we studied the combination of docetaxel and estramustine on androgen-sensitive and androgen-independent cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Estramustine did not increase the activity of docetaxel in these models. CONCLUSION: These results provide a strong preclinical rationale for the clinical development of docetaxel for the treatment of both locally advanced and disseminated prostate cancer.",include,estramustine,prostate cancer,In Vitro/In Vivo,No effect
25550798,Effect of celecoxib combined with chemotherapy drug on malignant biological behaviors of gastric cancer.,"Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, has been reported to have antitumor effects. In some tumor models, the combination of celecoxib with chemotherapy agents has shown synergistic antitumor effect; however, the effect of celecoxib combination with tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium on the malignant biological behaviors of gastric cancer in nude mice is unclear. In this study, female nude mice were subcutaneously transplanted with SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells. When the tumor model formed, the mice were divided into control group, celecoxib group, tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium group, and the combination of both drug regimens group. Mice were treated for 3 weeks. Following treatment, the proliferating index was calculated, apoptosis related proteins, COX-2, vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and lymphatic vessel density were quantified in tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining. The results revealed that celecoxib and tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium alone significantly inhibited tumor growth. The combination of these two drugs showed a synergistic antitumor effect. Both celecoxib and tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium alone inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis. The combination of these two drugs further enhanced this anticancer effect. Both celecoxib and the combination treatment inhibited lymphangiogenesis and the expression of COX-2 and VEGF-C. However, tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium treatment had no obvious effect on lymphangiogenesis. These results suggested that the combination of celecoxib and tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium produced a synergistic antitumor effect, possibly by inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells and promoting apoptosis. Celecoxib and celecoxib in combination with tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium possibly by reducing the expression of COX-2, in turn down-regulating the expression of VEGF-C, resulted in the inhibition of lymphangiogenesis.",include,celecoxib,gastric cancer,In Vivo,Effective
30414098,Mebendazole and radiation in combination increase survival through anticancer mechanisms in an intracranial rodent model of malignant meningioma.,"PURPOSE: Meningiomas are a frequent tumor of the central nervous system. Although mostly benign, approximately 5% present as atypical or malignant tumors. Treatments for atypical meningiomas include gross total resection and radiotherapy, but about 33% of patients have recurrent tumors, sometimes as a higher grade. Recently, the brain penetrant anthelmintic drug, mebendazole, has shown promise as an anticancer agent in rodent models of glioblastoma and medulloblastoma. METHODS: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) effect on colony formation, cell proliferation, and caspase-3/7 markers of apoptosis of mebendazole with and without radiation was measured in vitro. Mice intracranially implanted with KT21MG1 human meningioma were administered mebendazole alone or in combination with radiation. Survival benefit was evaluated, while tumors were investigated by immunohistochemical staining for apoptosis, cell proliferation, and vascular density. RESULTS: In vitro experiments on meningioma cell lines showed the IC<sub>50</sub> for mebendazole in the range of 0.26-0.42√Ç √Ç¬µM. Mebendazole alone induced cytotoxicity, however the combination had a greater reduction in colony formation and resulted in higher levels of cleaved caspase-3. The in vivo study showed both, mebendazole alone and the combination, to have a survival benefit with an increase in apoptosis, and decreases in tumor cell and vascular proliferation. CONCLUSION: These preclinical findings indicate that mebendazole alone or in combination with radiation can be considered for the treatment of malignant meningioma. The mechanism of action for this combination may include an increase in apoptosis, a reduction in proliferation and angiogenesis, or a combination of these effects.",include,mebendazole,meningioma,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
27470571,Candesartan attenuates angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma via downregulating AT1R/VEGF pathway.,"Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) was reported to express in many types of tumors, promoting tumor growth and angiogenesis. We herein examined AT1R expression in liver cancer and the potential antitumor effects of AT1R antagonist Candesartan in liver cancer. We found that AT1R expression was positively correlated with VEGF-A expression and microvascular density (MVD) in 40 HCC patients. Angiotensin II and Candesartan neither had effects on the proliferation of liver cancer cells in vitro. However, Angiotensin II upregulated AT1R protein expression and promoted production of VEGF-A in liver cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Candesartan was able to reverse this process in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Candesartan downregulated the expression of VEGF-A in SMMC-7721 bearing xenografts in mice and inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. Our data suggested that AT1R antagonist Candesartan might be useful to suppress liver cancer by inhibiting angiogenesis.",include,candesartan,liver cancer,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
22271897,The human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitor nelfinavir impairs proteasome activity and inhibits the proliferation of multiple myeloma cells in vitro and in vivo.,"BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is characterized by the accumulation of tumor plasma cells in the bone marrow. Despite therapeutic improvements brought by proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, myeloma remains an incurable disease. In a variety of human cancers, human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors (e.g. nelfinavir) effectively inhibit tumor progression, but their impact on myeloma is unknown. We assessed the in vitro and in vivo effects of nelfinavir on multiple myeloma. DESIGN AND METHODS: The effects of nelfinavir (1-10 √é¬ºM) on proteasome activity, proliferation and viability of myeloma cell lines and plasma cells from patients were assessed by measuring PERK, AKT, STAT3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and CHOP expression with immunoblotting or flow cytometry. The in vivo effect was assessed in NOD/SCID mice injected with luciferase expressing human myeloma cell lines and treated with nelfinavir at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day. Tumor progression was evaluated using a bioluminescent system. RESULTS: Nelfinavir inhibited 26S chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity, impaired proliferation and triggered apoptosis of the myeloma cell lines and fresh plasma cells. It activated the pro-apoptotic unfolded protein response pathway by inducing PERK phosphorylation and CHOP expression. Cell death triggered by nelfinavir treatment correlated with decreased phosphorylation of AKT, STAT3 and ERK1/2. Nelfinavir enhanced the anti-proliferative activity of bortezomib, dexamethasone and histone deacetylase inhibitors and delayed tumor growth in a myeloma mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that nelfinavir, used at a pharmacological dosage, alone or in combination, may be useful in the treatment of myeloma. Our data provide a preclinical basis for clinical trials using nelfinavir in patients with myeloma.",include,nelfinavir,multiple myeloma,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
27779705,Diphenhydramine induces melanoma cell apoptosis by suppressing STAT3/MCL-1 survival signaling and retards B16-F10 melanoma growth in vivo.,"Melanoma is the most aggressive skin malignancy with a high rate of mortality and is frequently refractory to many therapeutics, thus demanding the discovery of novel effective anti-melanoma agents. Diphenhydramine√Ç (DPH) is an H1 histamine receptor antagonist and a relatively safe drug. Previous studies have revealed the in√Ç vitro cytotoxicity of DPH against melanoma cells, but the mechanisms involved concerning its cytotoxicity and the in√Ç vivo anti-melanoma effect remain unknown. We herein present the first evidence supporting that DPH is selectively proapoptotic for a panel of melanoma cell lines irrespective of BRAFV600E status while sparing normal melanocytes. Of note, DPH effectively suppressed tumor growth and prolonged the length of survival of mice bearing B16-F10 melanoma. Mechanistic investigation further revealed that DPH downregulated antiapoptotic MCL-1, whereas MCL-1 overexpression impeded the proapoptotic action of DPH. Moreover, DPH attenuated STAT3 activation, as evidenced by the reduced levels of tyrosine 705-phosphorylated STAT3. Notably, ectopic expression of constitutively active STAT3 mutant reduced DPH-induced apoptosis but also protected MCL-1 from downregulation by DPH, illustrating that DPH impairs STAT3 activation to block STAT3-mediated induction of MCL-1 in eliciting apoptosis. Collectively, we for the first time validate the in√Ç vivo anti√¢‚Ç¨‚Äòmelanoma effect of DPH and also establish DPH as a drug targeting STAT3/MCL-1 survival signaling pathway to induce apoptosis. Our discovery therefore suggests the potential to repurpose DPH as an anti-melanoma therapeutic agent.",include,diphenhydramine,melanoma,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
29956761,Aclidinium bromide inhibits the growth and metastasis of gastric cancer MKN‚Äë28 cells via the PI3K signaling pathway.,"The present study investigated the effect and underling mechanisms of aclidinium bromide, a novel, inhaled long‚Äëacting muscarinic antagonist, on the development of gastric cancer. Human gastric cancer MKN‚Äë28 cells, as a model in¬†vitro, were treated with aclidinium bromide and dimethyl sulfoxide. Cell Counting Kit‚Äë8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry were used to assess cell proliferation, invasion/migration and apoptosis, respectively. In addition, western blotting was performed to determine the relative expression of proteins associated with apoptosis and the phosphatidylinositol‚Äë3‚Äëkinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Optical density values of MKN‚Äë28 cells were decreased in a time‚Äë and dose‚Äëdependent manner in the aclidinium bromide treated group. Matrigel invasion analysis demonstrated the number of invasive cells were significantly decreased in the aclidinium bromide‚Äëtreated group when compared with the control group. Furthermore, aclidinium bromide led to the marked reduction of the number of MKN‚Äë28 cells passing though the microwells of the transwell chamber. The expression levels of the anti‚Äëapoptotic protein B‚Äëcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‚Äë2) decreased, and the expression of pro‚Äëapoptotic proteins active Caspase3 and Bcl‚Äë2‚Äëassociated X protein increased concurrently following aclidinium bromide stimulation using western blotting. The phosphorylation of protein kinase B and mechanistic target of rapamycin were significantly inhibited in MKN‚Äë28 cells treated with aclidinium bromide; and the activity of the downstream proteins such as p70S6K and Cyclin¬†D1 were also significantly decreased. In conclusion, aclidinium bromide could inhibit gastric cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, which may be associated with the enhancement of apoptosis induced by the PI3K signaling pathway.",include,aclidinium bromide,gastric cancer,In Vitro,Effective
24412605,Hepatoblastoma cells express truncated neurokinin-1 receptor and can be growth inhibited by aprepitant in vitro and in vivo.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Multidrug resistance presents a major problem in hepatoblastoma (HB), and new anti-tumor strategies are desperately needed. The substance P (SP)/neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) complex has been discovered to be pivotal in the development of a variety of human cancers, and NK1R antagonists, such as the clinical drug aprepitant, are promising future anticancer agents. Yet, the role of the SP/NK1R complex as a potential anticancer target in HB is unknown. METHODS: Human HB cell lines HepT1, HepG2, and HuH6, human tumor samples from 17 children with HB as well as mice xenografted with human HB cell line HuH6 were analyzed regarding the SP/NK1R complex as a potential new anti-tumor target in HB. RESULTS: Therapeutic targeting with the NK1R antagonists aprepitant, L-733,060, and L-732,138 led to growth inhibition and apoptosis in HepT1, HepG2, and HuH6 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Intriguingly, HB cells predominantly expressed the truncated splice variant of NK1R. Human fibroblasts showed only dismal NK1R expression and were significantly more resistant. Stimulation of HB cells with SP, NK1R's natural ligand, caused increased growth rates and abrogated the anti-proliferative effect of NK1R antagonists. Expression analysis of 17 human HB samples confirmed the clinical relevance of NK1R. Most importantly, oral treatment of a HuH6 xenograft mouse model with 80mg/kg/day aprepitant for 24days resulted in a striking reduction of tumor growth, as evidenced by reduced tumor volume and weight, lowered tumor-specific alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) serum levels, and decreased number of Ki-67 positive cells. Furthermore, aprepitant treatment inhibited in vivo angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we describe the NK1R in its truncated splice variant as a potent target in human HB and an inhibitory effect in vivo and in vitro by NK1R antagonists. Therefore, NK1R antagonists should be considered promising new candidates for innovative therapeutic strategies against HB.",include,aprepitant,hepatoblastoma,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
25666502,Low Concentration of Caffeine Inhibits the Progression of the Hepatocellular Carcinoma via Akt Signaling Pathway.,"Accumulating evidences have reported that caffeine has anticancer effects at high blood concentrations. However, whether caffeine has anticancer effects on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells at low concentration, especially at physiologically applicable concentration (< 412 ŒºM) is still not well understood. In this study, HCC cell lines HepG2 and Huh7 were used. The cells were incubated with varying concentrations of caffeine (0, 50, 100, 200, 400 or 600 ŒºM). MTT assay was used to investigate the proliferation ability in vitro. Migration and invasion abilities were determined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. The molecular changes were detected by western blot. An ectopic nude mice model which the mice were gavaged with caffeine was used to reveal the anticancer effects of caffeine on HepG2 cells in vivo. Results showed that caffeine could inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion significantly at physiologically applicable concentration in vitro. Also the associated molecular changes of cancer progression were observed. In animal experiment, the mice gavaged with caffeine also performanced reduced tumor burden in vivo. Moreover, the interrelated protein expression was also observed in vivo which was coincident with the results in vitro. All in all, this observation indicated that caffeine may suppress the progression of HCC through Akt signaling pathway. This makes caffeine a potential candidate for treating HCC which will be a safer and more effective treatment by giving for a long time at physiologically applicable concentration.",include,caffeine,hepatocellular carcinoma,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
12231542,Mebendazole elicits a potent antitumor effect on human cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo.,"We have found that mebendazole (MZ), a derivative of benzimidazole, induces a dose- and time-dependent apoptotic response in human lung cancer cell lines. In this study, MZ arrested cells at the G(2)-M phase before the onset of apoptosis, as detected by using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. MZ treatment also resulted in mitochondrial cytochrome c release, followed by apoptotic cell death. Additionally, MZ appeared to be a potent inhibitor of tumor cell growth with little toxicity to normal WI38 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. When administered p.o. to nu/nu mice, MZ strongly inhibited the growth of human tumor xenografts and significantly reduced the number and size of tumors in an experimental model of lung metastasis. In assessing angiogenesis, we found significantly reduced vessel densities in MZ-treated mice compared with those in control mice.

14871995,Phenylbutyrate and phenylacetate induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation of human medulloblastoma cells.,"PURPOSE: Phenylbutyrate (PB) and phenylacetate (PA) have antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effects in malignant tumors, and had been evaluated in Phase I/II clinical trials. This study was undertaken to evaluate their antitumor activities in medulloblastomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The biological effects of PB and PA, ranging from 0.1 mM to 3 mM, on two medulloblastoma cell lines (DAOY and D283-MED) were examined using various long-term in vitro and in vivo assays for morphology, proliferation, differentiation, anchorage-independent growth, apoptosis, and tumorigenicity. RESULTS: PB and PA can both induce morphological changes and suppress proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These effects were more pronounced with PB and became irreversible in D283-MED cells after continuous exposure to 3 mM PB for 28 days. Both PB and PA were able to increase expression of glial marker glial fibriliary acidic protein and neuronal marker synaptophysin in two cell lines. For anchorage-independent growth, PB showed a more significant suppression than PA in D283-MED cells. PB caused more pronounced cell cycle arrest and remarkably reduced tumorigenicity in D283-MED cells than in DAOY cells. Apoptosis was readily induced in D283-MED cells with either low dose of PB or short-term treatment. In contrast, much higher concentrations of PB or longer treatment were required to achieve similar effect with DAOY cells. PB induced increased histones H3 acetylation in both cell lines, but histone H4 acetylation was only observed in D283-MED cells. CONCLUSIONS: PB, through induction of hyperacetylation of histone H3 and H4, is a much more potent antitumor agent than PA. 283-MED cells are more responsive to PB than DAOY cells, which may be dependent on their original state of differentiation as well as the changes of histone H4 acetylation status.",include,phenylbutyrate,medulloblastoma,In Vitro,Effective
21374736,Chemoprevention of lung carcinogenesis by the combination of aerosolized budesonide and oral pioglitazone in A/J mice.,"Budesonide, a synthetic glucocorticoid used for treating asthma, and pioglitazone, a synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors Œ≥ ligand used for the treatment of diabetes, were evaluated for their combinational chemopreventive efficacy on mouse lung cancer using female A/J mice with benzo(a)pyrene used as the carcinogen. All chemopreventive treatments began 2-wk post-carcinogen treatment and continued daily for 20 wk. Budesonide was administered by the aerosol route using an improved aerosol delivery system. Pioglitazone was introduced by oral gavage. The characterization of drug distribution showed that budesonide introduced by aerosol delivery accumulated only in the lung. Budesonide alone reduced tumor load by 78% and pioglitazone alone reduced tumor load by 63%. By combining aerosolized budesonide with pioglitazone, the inhibition on tumor load was 90%. In vitro experiments using human cancer cells showed that budesonide and pioglitazone exhibited independent, additive inhibitory effects on cell growth. Our results provide evidence that aerosolized budesonide and oral pioglitazone could be a promising drug combination for lung cancer chemoprevention.",include,budesonide,lung cancer,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
25446664,Metformin inhibits ovarian cancer growth and increases sensitivity to paclitaxel in mouse models.,"OBJECTIVE: There is increasing preclinical evidence indicating that metformin, a medication commonly used for type 2 diabetes mellitus, may protect against cancer. Motivated by this emerging evidence we asked 2 questions: (1) can metformin prevent ovarian cancer growth by altering metabolism and (2) will metformin increase sensitivity to chemotherapy. STUDY DESIGN: The effect of metformin in ovarian cancer was tested in¬†vitro and with 2 different mouse models. In¬†vitro, cell lines (n¬†= 6) were treated with metformin (10-40 mmol/L) or phosphate-buffered saline solution and cellular proliferation and metabolic alterations (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activity, glycolysis, and lipid synthesis) were compared between the 2 groups. In mouse models, a prevention study was performed by treating mice with metformin (250¬†mg/kg/d intraperitoneally) or placebo for 2 weeks followed by intraperitoneal injection of the SKOV3ip1 human ovarian cancer cell line, and the mean number of tumor implants in each treatment group was compared. In a treatment study, the LSL-K-ras(G12D/+)/PTEN(floxP/floxP) genetic mouse model of ovarian cancer was used. Mice were treated with placebo, paclitaxel (3 mg/kg/wk intraperitoneally for 7 weeks), metformin (100 mg/kg/d in water for 7 weeks), or paclitaxel plus metformin, and tumor volume was compared among treatment groups. RESULTS: In¬†vitro, metformin decreased proliferation of ovarian cancer cell lines and induced cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis. Further analysis showed that metformin altered several aspects of metabolism including adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activity, glycolysis, and lipid synthesis. In the prevention mouse model, mice that were pretreated with metformin had 60% fewer tumor implants compared with controls (P < .005). In the treatment study, mice that were treated with paclitaxel plus metformin had a 60% reduction in tumor weight compared with controls (P¬†= .02), which is a level of tumor reduction greater than that resulting from either paclitaxel or metformin alone. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, we conclude that metformin¬†alters metabolism in ovarian cancer cells, prevents tumor growth, and increases sensitivity to chemotherapy in¬†vitro and in mouse models. These preclinical findings suggest that metformin warrants further investigation for use as an ovarian cancer therapeutic.",include,metformin,ovarian cancer,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective

Metformin is an orally taken hypoglycemic agent, which is extensively applied in the clinic. Clinical trials find that there may be a certain degree of action of the metformin in inhibiting malignant tumors. This paper aims to investigate the inhibitory effect and mechanism of metformin on human ovarian cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through in vitro cell experiment, the influences of metformin on the proliferation, colony formation and apoptosis of ovarian carcinoma cells were studied. Ovarian cancer cells SKOV-3 and A2780 in logarithmic growth phase were selected and cell proliferation was measured by MTT method. The metformin was processed for 48 h to calculate the survival rate of cells. Also, metformin was processed for 24 h and two weeks or stained with crystal violet, after which Quantity One (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) method was used to quantitatively analyze the cell clone formation, meanwhile, the FCM (flow cytometry) was used for the detection and analysis. RESULTS: Intervened by metformin with different concentrations for 48 h, the cell viabilities of SKOV-3 and A2780 cells were respectively reduced by 19.49 ¬± 2.92%, 45.41 ¬± 7.95%, 53.84 ¬± 5.53%, 64.04 ¬± 4.36% and 11.45 ¬± 3.12%, 35.42 ¬± 7.55%, 43.77 ¬± 5.77%, 53.05 ¬± 5.55% as compared with that in the control group with statistical significances. After processed by metformin with different concentrations for two weeks, the cells clone numbers of SKOV-3 and A2780 were significantly reduced.

23490148,"A novel metformin derivative, HL010183, inhibits proliferation and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells.","Mounting evidence suggests that metformin (N,N-dimethylbiguanide), a widely prescribed drug for the treatment of type II diabetes, exerts an anti-tumor effect on several cancers including breast cancer. Breast cancer has been estimated as one of the most commonly diagnosed types of cancer among women. In particular, triple-negative breast cancers are associated with poor prognosis and metastatic growth. In the present study, we synthesized a novel metformin derivative 5 (HL010183) and metformin salts, 9a, 9b, and 9c (metformin gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) salt, metformin pregabalin salt and metformin gabapentin salt), which exerted more potent inhibitory effects on the proliferation and invasiveness of Hs578T triple-negative breast carcinoma cells than metformin. Importantly, 5 showed approximately 100-fold more potent effects compared to metformin. In a triple-negative breast cancer xenograft model, 5 showed a comparable degree of inhibitory effect on in vivo tumor growth at the 100mg/kg dose to that of metformin at 500 mg/kg. Our results clearly demonstrate that 5 exerts a potent anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in vivo, paving the way for a strategy for treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.",include,metformin,breast cancer,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
24327721,Naproxen induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in human urinary bladder cancer cell lines and chemically induced cancers by targeting PI3K.,"Naproxen [(S)-6-methoxy-Œ±-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid] is a potent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 and is widely used as an over-the-counter medication. Naproxen exhibits analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Naproxen, as well as other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has been reported to be effective in the prevention of urinary bladder cancer in rodents. However, potential targets other than the COX isozymes have not been reported. We examined potential additional targets in urinary bladder cancer cells and in rat bladder cancers. Computer kinase profiling results suggested that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a potential target for naproxen. In vitro kinase assay data revealed that naproxen interacts with PI3K and inhibits its kinase activity. Pull-down binding assay data confirmed that PI3K directly binds with naproxen in vitro and ex vivo. Western blot data showed that naproxen decreased phosphorylation of Akt, and subsequently decreased Akt signaling in UM-UC-5 and UM-UC-14 urinary bladder cancer cells. Furthermore, naproxen suppressed anchorage-independent cell growth and decreased cell viability by targeting PI3K in both cell lines. Naproxen caused an accumulation of cells at the G1 phase mediated through cyclin-dependent kinase 4, cyclin D1, and p21. Moreover, naproxen induced significant apoptosis, accompanied with increased levels of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7, and PARP in both cell types. Naproxen-induced cell death was mainly because of apoptosis in which a prominent downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax were involved. Naproxen also caused apoptosis and inhibited Akt phosphorylation in rat urinary bladder cancers induced by N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine.",include,naproxen,bladder cancer,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
10411103,"Inhibitory effects of roxithromycin on tumor angiogenesis, growth and metastasis of mouse B16 melanoma cells.","We examined the effects of roxithromycin, a 14-membered ring macrolide antibiotic, on tumor angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis of mouse B16BL6 melanoma cells. The inhibitory effect of roxithromycin on angiogenesis using mouse dorsal air sac model was dose-dependent, and 100 mg/kg of roxithromycin administered intraperitoneally twice a day reduced the dense capillary network area to about 20% of the control. Administration of roxithromycin histologically reduced the development of microvessels and mononuclear cell infiltration. In vivo tumor growth studies demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of roxithromycin at 20 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day reduced tumor size of B16BL6 melanoma to about 56% and 33% (experiment 1), 71% and 48% (experiment 2) of that in the respective controls. Roxithromycin also significantly inhibited pulmonary metastasis of B16BL6 cells in a spontaneous system. The inhibitory activities of roxithromycin on angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis were compared with those of a potent angiogenesis inhibitor, TNP-470. These data demonstrated that roxithromycin has potent antiangiogenic and antitumor effects and might have possible therapeutic applications.",include,roxithromycin,melanoma,In Vivo,Effective
20109999,Effectiveness and tolerability of colesevelam hydrochloride for bile-acid malabsorption in patients with cancer: a retrospective chart review and patient questionnaire.,"BACKGROUND: Commercially available bile-acid sequestrants are not well tolerated by >80% of patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of colesevelam hydrochloride in patients who developed bile-acid malabsorption after cancer therapy. METHODS: The present study comprised 2 parts: a retrospective chart review of the electronic patient records and a patient questionnaire assessing outcome measures. All patients included in this study had a diagnosis of cancer and were being followed up in a cancer clinic at The Royal Marsden Hospital. In addition, all had symptoms of bile-acid malabsorption for >3 months and had been prescribed colesevelam in the gastroenterology clinic at the hospital. The electronic records of patients who were prescribed colesevelam between 2004 and 2007 were obtained from the hospital pharmacy. Those patients who were prescribed colesevelam and did not take any of the prescribed medication or did not return for a follow-up clinical review were excluded. To help further assess outcomes, a questionnaire was mailed to patients who were still residing in the United Kingdom, were not terminally ill, and were not lost to follow-up. The questionnaire comprised questions that assessed medication history (ie, whether patients were still taking colesevelam or not [and the reason for not taking colesevelam]), dosage, effectiveness for symptom relief, and adverse events. RESULTS: In total, 45 patients (37 women and 8 men; median age, 58 years [range, 32-89 years]) who received treatment with colesevelam between 2004 and 2007 were included. Of these, 36 were sent a questionnaire and 30 responded. Identifiable causes of bile acid malabsorption in this sample population were pelvic radiotherapy (n = 29), small-bowel resection (12), upper gastrointestinal surgery (2), high-dose chemotherapy (1), and new-onset Crohn's disease (1). Of these patients, 67% (30/45) had not previously responded to cholestyramine treatment, but following treatment with colesevelam, this group had a recorded improvement in: diarrhea, 83% (25/30); urgency of defecation, 74% (20/27); frequency of defecation, 72% (21/29); steatorrhea, 71% (12/17); abdominal pain, 68% (15/22); and fecal incontinence, 62% (13/21). Based on the medical chart review and the patient questionnaire, after colesevelam treatment, the following proportions of all 45 patients studied experienced improvement in symptoms: loose stool (diarrhea), 88% (medical chart) and 80% (questionnaire); frequency of defecation, 77% and 83%, respectively; steatorrhea, 76% and 80%; urgency of defecation, 76% and 80%; abdominal pain, 74% and 58%; and fecal incontinence, 69% and 74%. During the study period, 15 patients discontinued colesevelam: ineffectiveness, 5; adverse events, 5 (because >or=1 of the following: bloating, constipation, heartburn, abdominal pain, flatulence, or perianal soreness); and other reasons, 7 (too many tablets or tablets difficult to swallow [3]; symptoms resolved [2]; colesevelam replaced with another medication [1]; and lost to follow-up [1]). Sixty-seven percent (30/45) of patients continued using colesevelam for up to 4 years. CONCLUSION: In view of the data found in this retrospective chart review and patient questionnaire, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of colesevelam for bile acid malabsorption are warranted.",exclude,,,,
27344439,A post hoc analysis of dalteparin versus oral anticoagulant (VKA) therapy for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (rVTE) in patients with cancer and renal impairment.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and serious complication in patients with cancer; treatment guidelines recommend extended therapy of √¢‚Ä∞¬•6√Ç months with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for treatment and prevention of recurrent VTE (rVTE) in this population. This post hoc analysis used data from the CLOT study-a phase III, randomized, open-label, controlled study (N√Ç =√Ç 676)-to compare the efficacy and safety of dalteparin, a LMWH, versus vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for prevention of rVTE in patients with cancer and renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60√Ç ml/min). Overall, 162/676 (24√Ç %) patients had renal impairment at baseline. Patients received subcutaneous dalteparin 200√Ç IU/kg once daily during month 1, followed by 150√Ç IU/kg once daily for months 2-6; or VKA once daily for 6√Ç months, with initial overlapping subcutaneous dalteparin 200√Ç IU/kg once daily for √¢‚Ä∞¬•5√Ç days until international normalized ratio was 2.0-3.0 for 2 consecutive days. Endpoints included the rates of rVTE (primary) and bleeding events. Overall, fewer dalteparin-treated patients (2/74 [2.7√Ç %]) experienced √¢‚Ä∞¬•1 adjudicated symptomatic rVTE compared with VKA-treated patients (15/88 [17.0√Ç %]; hazard ratio√Ç =√Ç 0.15 [95√Ç % confidence interval 0.03-0.65]; p√Ç =√Ç 0.01). Bleeding event rates for both treatments were similar (p√Ç =√Ç 0.47). In summary, compared with VKA, dalteparin significantly reduced risk of rVTE in patients with cancer and renal impairment (p√Ç =√Ç 0.01) while exhibiting a comparable safety profile. This analysis supports dosing patients with renal impairment in accordance with patients with normal renal function; however, anti-Xa monitoring could be considered to further support safety in selected patients, particularly those with very severe renal impairment.",exclude,,,,
28120698,Short-course daptomycin lock and systemic therapy for catheter-related bloodstream infections: a retrospective cohort study in cancer patients with surgically implanted devices.,"PURPOSE: Few in vivo studies have been reported describing efficacy and duration of antibiotic lock therapy (ALT) with daptomycin (DPT) for long-term catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). We retrospectively analysed the efficacy of short-course ALT with DPT in combination with systemic treatment (ST) for CoNS-associated CRBSI in our hospital. METHODS: Patients admitted for CoNS-associated CRBSI and treated with DPT as ALT and ST were retrospectively analysed. Success was defined as preservation of the catheter device 30 days after ending treatment. Catheter removal within 30 days of discontinuing treatment, for either microbiological documentation of CRBSI relapse or re-occurrence of unexplained fever, was considered as failure. RESULTS: Among 7610 patients admitted to the Departments of Internal Medicine/Infectious Diseases and Pneumology in Cannes from January 2013 to November 2015, we identified 28 episodes of CoNS-associated CRBSI. Seven patients died of cancer during follow-up. Thus, 21 episodes were analysed among 20 patients (median age 67 years, 12 males, all treated for neoplasia and carrying a port-a-cath√Ç¬Æ device). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the main agent responsible for CRBSI. Median duration of systemic and ALT DPT was 3 days, in combination with rifampin for 4 days and then generally followed by a switch to oral drugs, most frequently cotrimoxazole or linezolid, to achieve 14 median days of treatment. Clinical success and failure rates were 76% and 24%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Short-course DPT as ALT, combined with 14 days of ST, allowed conservative management of CoNS-associated CRBSI in surgically implanted-catheters in three-fourth of cases.",exclude,,,,

Eligible patients were randomized to slow-release morphine plus DM or slow-release morphine plus placebo. The initial DM dose was 60 mg four times daily for seven days, with an increase to 120 mg four times daily, if tolerated, for another seven days. During the study, patients recorded medications and scores for pain, nausea, drowsiness, and insomnia. Sixty-five patients were randomized. Although average pain scores (12.6 vs. 15.8), number of breakthrough doses (9 vs. 11.3), and change in total morphine consumption (550.9 mg vs. 597.1mg) were less in the DM group than placebo group, the differences were not statistically significant (P=0.31-0.33). Side-effect scores were not statistically significantly different. Dizziness was greater in the DM (58%) than placebo (36%) group. This study showed a statistically nonsignificant enhancement of analgesia or modulation of opioid tolerance in cancer patients with pain when DM was added to morphine. Participants receiving the DM also had more toxicity, particularly dizziness. This toxicity and the limited evidence of effect do not support the use of DM to enhance opioid analgesia or to modulate opioid tolerance in cancer patients.",exclude,,,,

Dolasetron Comparative Chemotherapy-induced Emesis Prevention Group.","PURPOSE: To assess the comparative antiemetic efficacy of single-dose intravenous (IV) dolasetron mesylate and ondansetron in preventing cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer patients (n = 609) receiving first-course cisplatin chemotherapy were randomized to one of three treatments: 1.8 or 2.4 mg/kg dolasetron mesylate salt (equivalent to 1.3 and 1.8 mg/kg dolasetron base, respectively) or 32 mg ondansetron. Each treatment was infused over 15 minutes, 30 minutes before cisplatin administration. Patients were stratified to cisplatin doses of > or = 70 and less than 91 mg/m2 (n = 368) or > or = 91 mg/m2 (n = 241), administered over < or = 3 hours. Protocol-defined efficacy criteria included complete response (zero emetic episodes and no rescue medication), major response (1 to 2 emetic episodes and no rescue medication), and patients' report of nausea severity and satisfaction recorded on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: The three treatments met protocol-specified criteria for equivalence. Complete response rates for dolasetron mesylate 1.8 mg/kg, 2.4 mg/kg, and ondansetron, respectively, were 49.2%, 45.6%, and 50.4% for patients in the lower cisplatin stratum (mean, 74.7 mg/m2) and 36.8%, 31.3%, and 31.8% in the higher cisplatin stratum (mean, 100.6 mg/m2). No significant differences were observed in the extent of nausea with either dolasetron dose compared with ondansetron. Less nausea was noted with 1.8 mg/kg dolasetron compared with the 2.4 mg/kg dose (P = .044) All three antiemetic treatments were well tolerated. Asymptomatic electrocardiogram changes were recorded with both dolasetron and ondansetron. CONCLUSION: A single IV dose of dolasetron mesylate (1.8 or 2.4 mg/kg) has comparable safety and efficacy to a single 32-mg IV dose of ondansetron in patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy.",exclude,,,,

Chemical permeation enhancers were evaluated and selected according to the results obtained from rheological studies, drug release, and drug permeation and retention through buccal mucosa. Finally, the selected formulation was compared in vivo, with a reference DOX mouthwash, whose clinical efficacy had been previously reported. The obtained findings showed that an orabase√Ç¬Æ platform loading transcutol√Ç¬Æ (10%) and menthol (5%) for the buccal vehiculization of DOX exhibited a decreased elastic and viscous behavior improving its application. The main drug release mechanism could be considered as diffusion according to Higuchi model. Obtained DOX permeation rates were considered optimal for an analgesic effect and far below to an antidepressant activity. Similar in vivo plasma concentrations were found for the semisolid formulation and the reference mouthwash. However, DOX amounts retained in the mucosa of animals for the semisolid formulation were higher than the reference, which let us hypostatize even stronger potential local therapeutic effect with additional advantages such as, mucoadhesive properties, absence of alcohol, some degree of freshness, as well as, drug palatability improvement.",exclude,,,,
19108790,"Comparison of propofol, droperidol, and metoclopramide for prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting after breast cancer surgery: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in Japanese patients.","BACKGROUND: Breast cancer surgery performed with the patient under general anesthesia has been associated with a relatively high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Between 60% and 80% of patients who undergo mastectomy (with axillary dissection) experience PONV. We previously reported that propofol at a subhypnotic dose of 0.5 mg/kg was more effective than placebo in preventing PONV in women who undergo mastectomy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of a subhypnotic dose of propofol with the conventional antiemetics droperidol and metoclopramide for the prophylaxis of PONV after breast cancer surgery in Japanese patients. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Japanese women were randomized to 1 of 4 groups to receive IV administration of propofol 0.5 mg/kg, droperidol 20 microg/kg, metoclopramide 0.2 mg/kg, or placebo (isotonic saline) immediately after skin suture. A standard general anesthetic technique, including sevoflurane and air in oxygen, was used. All episodes of PONV during the first 24 hours after anesthesia administration were recorded by an investigator who was blinded to treatment assignment. The investigator questioned the patients as to whether they experienced extrapyramidal symptoms. To maintain the integrity of the study results, none of the patients received preanesthetic medication. RESULTS: A total of 100 women (mean [SD] age, 52 [7] years; height, 154 [6] cm; weight, 54 [7] kg) were included in the study. Each study group comprised 25 patients. There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to patient demographics, surgery type, or awakening time. The prevalences of PONV 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia were 28% with propofol (P = 0.005), 32% with droperidol (P = 0.011), and 60% with metoclopramide (P = NS), compared with placebo (68%). No significant difference in the prevalence of PONV was found between patients receiving propofol and those receiving droperidol, and propofol and droperidol were associated with significantly lower prevalences of PONV compared with metoclopramide (P = 0.022 and P = 0.043, respectively). Extrapyramidal symptoms were not reported in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalences of PONV were not significantly different between propofol 0.5 mg/kg and droperidol 20 microg/kg 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia in this small, select group of Japanese women who underwent breast cancer surgery. The prevalences of PONV were significantly lower with propofol and droperidol compared with metoclopramide 0.2 mg/kg and placebo.",exclude,,,,
28184263,A low dose of droperidol decreases the desflurane concentration needed during breast cancer surgery: a randomized double-blinded study.,"BACKGROUND: Droperidol (DHB) reportedly reduces the dose of propofol needed to achieve hypnosis when anesthesia is induced and decreases the bispectral index (BIS) in propofol-sedated patients during spinal anesthesia. We reported previously that supplemental DHB decreased the BIS after the administration of sevoflurane and remifentanil. This study investigated the effect of DHB on desflurane (DES) consumption in a clinical setting. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized double-blinded study of 35 women with American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status I or II who underwent a mastectomy. Either DHB (20 √Ç¬µg/kg) or a saline placebo was administered to patients 30 min after the induction of anesthesia. A blinded anesthesiologist maintained a BIS value of 50 during anesthesia by modulating inhaled DES concentrations that changed 0.5% at 2.5 min intervals and maintained analgesia via the constant administration of remifentanil by referring to vital signs. The primary endpoint was the effect of DHB on DES consumption. The secondary endpoints included blood circulatory parameters, the time from the end of surgery to extubation, and discharge time between the groups. RESULTS: The characteristics of the patients did not differ between the groups. The DHB group used a mean of 27.2 √Ç¬± 6.0 ml of DES compared with 41.4 √Ç¬± 9.5 ml by the placebo group (P < 0.05).

Direct oral anticoagulants are non-inferior to conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. We hypothesised that edoxaban, a direct oral inhibitor of activated clotting factor Xa, might be more suitable than conventional anticoagulants in the management of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of edoxaban compared with warfarin in a subgroup of patients with cancer enrolled in the Hokusai-VTE trial. METHODS: We did a prespecified subgroup analysis in August, 2013, and a post-hoc analysis of non-inferiority and safety in March, 2016, of the patients with cancer enrolled in the randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre, Hokusai-VTE trial done between Jan 28, 2010, and Oct 31, 2012. In this study, patients aged at least 18 years with acute symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis or acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (with or without deep-vein thrombosis) were assigned to receive edoxaban 60 mg once per day (or 30 mg once per day for patients with a creatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/min, bodyweight <60 kg, or who were receiving concomitant treatment with the P-glycoprotein inhibitors quinidine or verapamil) or warfarin (dose adjusted to maintain the international normalised ratio between 2√Ç¬∑0 and 3√Ç¬∑0) or placebos for either group for at least 3 months up to 12 months. All patients received initial therapy with open-label enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin for at least 5 days. Edoxoban (or placebo) was started after discontinuation of initial heparin; warfarin (or placebo) started concurrently with the study regimen of heparin. In our analysis we examined data for a subgroup of these patients who had a history of cancer or who had been categorised as having active cancer by the study physician at the time of enrolment. Additionally, all patients with a history of cancer were reviewed post hoc and categorised according to the presence or absence of active cancer. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of these patients with symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism during the 12-month study period, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population, with an upper limit of the CI for the hazard ratio (HR) of 1√Ç¬∑5. The principal safety outcome was the proportion of patients who had clinically relevant bleeding in the population of patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00986154. FINDINGS: Of 771 patients with cancer enrolled in the trial, 378 were assigned to edoxaban and 393 to warfarin. Recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 14 (4%) of 378 patients given edoxaban and in 28 (7%) of 393 patients given warfarin (hazard ratio [HR] 0√Ç¬∑53, 95% CI 0√Ç¬∑28-1√Ç¬∑00; p=0√Ç¬∑0007). The upper limit of this 95% CI did not exceed the non-inferiority margin of 1√Ç¬∑5 that was prespecified for the trial. Clinically relevant bleeding (major or non-major) occurred in 47 (12%) of 378 patients who received edoxaban and in 74 (19%) of 393 patients who received warfarin; HR for clinically relevant bleeding 0√Ç¬∑64, 95% CI 0√Ç¬∑45-0√Ç¬∑92; p=0√Ç¬∑017. Major bleeding occurred in ten (3%) of 378 patients with a history of cancer who received edoxaban and in 13 (3%) of 393 who received warfarin (HR 0√Ç¬∑80, 95% CI 0√Ç¬∑35-1√Ç¬∑83). INTERPRETATION: Edoxaban might be as effective as warfarin for the treatment of patients with cancer with venous thromboembolism, and with less clinically relevant bleeding. Additional clinical trials of edoxaban versus low-molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer are warranted. FUNDING: Daiichi Sankyo.",exclude,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended-duration enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients. DESIGN: Randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled trial. Randomization was computer-generated. Allocation was centralized. Patients, caregivers, and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00077753) SETTING: 370 sites in 20 countries across North and South America, Europe, and Asia. PATIENTS: Acutely ill medical patients 40 years or older with recently reduced mobility (bed rest or sedentary without [level 1] or with [level 2] bathroom privileges). Eligibility criteria for patients with level 2 immobility were amended to include only those who had additional VTE risk factors (age >75 years, history of VTE, or active or previous cancer) after interim analyses suggested lower-than-expected VTE rates. INTERVENTION: Enoxaparin, 40 mg/d subcutaneously (2975 patients), or placebo (2988 patients), for 28 +/- 4 days after receiving open-label enoxaparin for an initial 10 +/- 4 days. MEASUREMENTS: Incidence of VTE up to day 28 and of major bleeding events up to 48 hours after the last study treatment dose. RESULTS: Extended-duration enoxaparin reduced VTE incidence compared with placebo (2.5% vs. 4%; absolute risk difference favoring enoxaparin, -1.53% [95.8% CI, -2.54% to -0.52%]). Enoxaparin increased major bleeding events (0.8% vs. 0.3%; absolute risk difference favoring placebo, 0.51% [95% CI, 0.12% to 0.89%]). The benefits of extended-duration enoxaparin seemed to be restricted to women, patients older than 75 years, and those with level 1 immobility. LIMITATION: Estimates of efficacy and safety for the overall trial population are difficult to interpret because of the change in eligibility criteria during the trial. CONCLUSION: Use of extended-duration enoxaparin reduces VTE more than it increases major bleeding events in acutely ill medical patients with level 1 immobility, those older than 75 years, and women.

We recently discovered the novel small-molecule DJ101 as a potent and metabolically stable tubulin inhibitor that can circumvent the drug efflux pumps responsible for multidrug resistance of existing tubulin inhibitors. In this study, we determined the mechanism of action of this drug. The basis for its activity was illuminated by solving the crystal structure of DJ101 in complex with tubulin at a resolution of 2.8√É‚Ä¶. Investigations of the potency of DJ101 in a panel of human metastatic melanoma cell lines harboring major clinically relevant mutations defined IC<sub>50</sub> values of 7-10 nmol/L. In cells, DJ101 disrupted microtubule networks, suppressed anchorage-dependent melanoma colony formation, and impaired cancer cell migration. In melanoma-bearing mice, DJ101 administration inhibited tumor growth and reduced lung metastasis in the absence of observable toxicity. DJ101 also completely inhibited tumor growth in a paclitaxel-resistant xenograft mouse model of human prostate cancer (PC-3/TxR), where paclitaxel was minimally effective. Our findings offer preclinical proof of concept for the continued development of DJ101 as a next-generation tubulin inhibitor for cancer therapy.<b>Significance:</b> These findings offer preclinical proof of concept for the continued development of DJ101 as a next-generation antitubulin drug for cancer therapy. <i>Cancer Res; 78(1); 265-77. √Ç¬©2017 AACR</i>.",exclude,,,,
25846632,"The novel desmopressin analogue [V4Q5]dDAVP inhibits angiogenesis, tumour growth and metastases in vasopressin type 2 receptor-expressing breast cancer models.","Desmopressin (dDAVP) is a safe haemostatic agent with previously reported antitumour activity. It acts as a selective agonist for the V2 vasopressin membrane receptor (V2r) present on tumour cells and microvasculature. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the novel peptide derivative [V4Q5]dDAVP in V2r-expressing preclinical mouse models of breast cancer. We assessed antitumour effects of [V4Q5]dDAVP using human MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells, as well as the highly metastatic mouse F3II cell line. Effect on in vitro cancer cell growth was evaluated by cell proliferation and clonogenic assays. Cell cycle distribution was analysed by flow cytometry. In order to study the effect of intravenously administered [V4Q5]dDAVP on tumour growth and angiogenesis, breast cancer xenografts were generated in athymic mice. F3II cells were injected into syngeneic mice to evaluate the effect of [V4Q5]dDAVP on spontaneous and experimental metastatic spread. In vitro cytostatic effects of [V4Q5]dDAVP against breast cancer cells were greater than those of dDAVP, and associated with V2r-activated signal transduction and partial cell cycle arrest. In MDA-MB-231 xenografts, [V4Q5]dDAVP (0.3 √Ç¬µg/kg, thrice a week) reduced tumour growth and angiogenesis.

19143029,Piperazine-designed alpha 1A/alpha 1D-adrenoceptor blocker KMUP-1 and doxazosin provide down-regulation of androgen receptor and PSA in prostatic LNCaP cells growth and specifically in xenografts.,"BACKGROUND: KMUP-1 has been suggested to be beneficial in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. This study is aimed to further investigate whether KMUP-1 and doxazosin prevent from prostate cancer cell growth via androgen-dependent and -independent pathway in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: KMUP-1 was measured the activity on proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, DU-145, PC-3) by MTT assay, flow cytometry, Western Blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The inhibition activities on androgen receptor (AR) and AR-targeting molecular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression by KMUP-1 and doxazosin were measured by RT-PCR, Western Blotting, and ELISA. Furthermore, we confirmed the effects of KMUP-1 on growth of LNCaP xenografts in nude mice. RESULTS: KMUP-1 significantly inhibited LNCaP cell growth and induced apoptosis in time- and dose-dependent manner. KMUP-1 and doxazosin further inhibited the expression of AR and PSA. Treatment of LNCaP cells with KMUP-1 resulted in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic activities, increasing p21 and p27 and decreasing expressions of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4, CDK2 and CDK6. Moreover, KMUP-1 activated p53, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3, but reduced the expression of Bcl-2. Regular administration of KMUP-1 suppressed the LNCaP xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. CONCLUSION: These evidences indicate that KMUP-1 and doxazosin inhibit LNCaP cell growth and downregulate expression of AR and PSA. KMUP-1 might be used as a chemoprevention agent for preventing the development of prostate cancer without cardiovascular adverse effect of doxazosin.",exclude,,,,
15082280,Effects of aminophylline on cytokines and pulmonary function in patients undergoing valve replacement.,"OBJECTIVE: This study is to evaluate the effects of aminophylline on systemic inflammatory response after cardiopulmonary bypass in patients undergoing valve replacement. METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing elective valve replacement were randomized to receive either aminophylline treatment (aminophylline, n = 15) or no aminophylline (control, n = 15). Administration of aminophylline (5 mg/kg) was injected intravenously after induction of anesthesia and maintained with 0.5 mg/kg per h until the end of cardiopulmonary bypass. Perioperative cytokines (interleukin-8 and interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and respiratory function, blood neutrophil count ratio of right atrium to that of left atrium, plasma malondialdehyde were measured during the experiment. RESULTS: Interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels after cardiopulmonary bypass were significantly lower in the aminophylline group than that in the control group (P < 0.05, for each group), and interleukin-10 level in aminophylline group was significantly higher than in control (P = 0.001). The respiratory index was greater in the control than in aminophylline group (P < 0.05). Neutrophil count ratio of right atrium blood to left atrium blood and plasma malondialdehyde level in aminophylline group were much lower (P = 0.02 and 0.001, respectively) than in the control 30 min after aortic declamping. Compared with control group, the duration of ventilation and intensive care unit stays were shorter in aminophylline group (P = 0.032 and 0.013, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative administration of aminophylline had anti-inflammatory effect and improved pulmonary oxygenation in patients undergoing valve replacement.",exclude,,,,
26457269,PATTERN OF OVERACTIVE BLADDER IN SOUTHEAST NIGERIA.,"BACKGROUND: Overactive bladder is a distressing condition characterized by the syndrome of uncontrollable urgency, day time frequency, nocturia with or without urgency urinary incontinence. AIM: To determine the pattern of overactive bladder in two tertiary health institutions in South-East Nigeria. STUDY DESIGN: The study is prospective. SETTING: Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki and Niger Foundation Hospital and Diagnostic centre Enugu in southeastern Nigeria. METHOD: The study involved 383 patients who were diagnosed with overactive bladder in the two hospitals during the study period. Their demographics, clinical feature, management options and outcome were analyzed.Tolterodine was the anticholinegic used to treat the syndrome while the underlying pathology was treated accordingly. RESULT: There were 383 patients out of which 363 (94.8%) patients were males while 20 (5.2%) patients were females with the age range of 37yrs to103yrs with a mean of 63.4yrs. A total of 313 (81.7%) patients had prostatic disease (benign prostatic hyperplasia and cancer of the prostate), while 99 (25.8%) patients had diabetes mellitus. Among the 313(82 %) with prostate disease, two hundred and eighty nine (75.5%) had benign prostatic hyperplasia while twenty four (6.3%) had cancer of the prostate. Urgency, urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence were observed simultaneously in 133 (34.7%) patients during the episode of involuntary painful bladder contraction. In 271 (71%) patients, the overactive bladder was treated with Tolterodine alone and management of the underlying pathology with resolution of symptoms. Few patients benefitted from behavioral therapy. CONCLUSION: Overactive bladder in this environment is associated commonly with prostate diseases with urgency of urine, urine and fecal incontinence but responds well to anticholinergic.",exclude,,,,

Because of the possibility of the enzyme inactivation by antibodies, monitoring of ASP activity is essential. The aim of the study was to examine if plasma concentration of ammonia, a direct product of the reaction catalyzed by ASP, can be used in the assessment of ASP activity. A group of 87 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated in the Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology in Krakow was enrolled to the study. ASP activity and ammonia concentration were measured after ASP administrations during induction. A positive correlation was found between the ammonia concentration and ASP activity (R = 0.44; P < 0.0001) and between the medium values of ammonia concentration and ASP activity (R = 0.56; P < 0.0001). The analysis of ROC curves revealed the moderate accuracy of the ammonia concentration values in the ASP activity assessment. It was also found that the medium value of ammonia concentrations can be useful in identification of the patients with low (<100√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞IU/L) and undetectable (<30√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞IU/L) ASP activity. The plasma ammonia concentration may reflect ASP activity and can be useful when a direct measurement of the activity is unavailable.",exclude,,,,

Acupuncture has a potential role in the treatment of CIPN, but at present there have been no randomized clinical research studies to analyze the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of CIPN, particularly in MM patients. METHODS: The MM patients (104 individuals) who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned into a solely methylcobalamin therapy group (500√Ç √é¬ºg intramuscular methylcobalamin injections every other day for 20√Ç days; ten injections) followed by 2√Ç months of 500√Ç √é¬ºg oral methylcobalamin administration, three times per day) and an acupuncture combined with methylcobalamin (Met√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞+√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞Acu) group (methylcobalamin used the same way as above accompanied by three cycles of acupuncture). Of the patients, 98 out of 104 completed the treatment and follow-ups. There were 49 patients in each group. The evaluating parameters included the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (Fact/GOG-Ntx) questionnaire scores, and electromyographic (EMG) nerve conduction velocity (NCV) determinations. We evaluated the changes of the parameters in each group before and after the therapies and made a comparison between the two groups. RESULTS: After 84√Ç days (three cycles) of therapy, the pain was significantly alleviated in both groups, with a significantly higher decrease in the acupuncture treated group (P√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞<√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞0.01). The patients' daily activity evaluated by Fact/GOG-Ntx questionnaires significantly improved in the Met√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞+√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞Acu group (P√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞<√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞0.001). The NCV in the Met√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞+√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞Acu group improved significantly while amelioration in the control group was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that acupuncture combined with methylcobalamin in the treatment of CIPN showed a better outcome than methylcobalamin administration alone.

16838234,"A randomized, open-label, multicenter comparative study of the efficacy and safety of piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic episodes in patients with hematologic malignancies.","BACKGROUND: The empirical treatment of febrile, neutropenic patients with cancer requires antibacterial regimens active against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. This study was performed to demonstrate the noninferiority of monotherapy with piperacillin-tazobactam, compared with cefepime. METHODS: We conducted a randomized-controlled, open-label, multicenter clinical trial among high-risk patients from 34 university-affiliated tertiary care medical centers in the United States, Canada, and Australia who were undergoing treatment for leukemia or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and were hospitalized for empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic episodes. Patients received piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 h) or cefepime (2 g every 8 h) intravenously. The primary outcome was success (defined by defervescence without treatment modification) at 72 h of treatment, end of treatment, and test of cure in the modified intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included time to defervescence, microbiological efficacy, the additional use of glycopeptide antibiotics, emergence of resistant bacteria, and safety. RESULTS: For 528 subjects (265 received piperacillin-tazobactam and 263 received cefepime), success rates were 57.7% and 48.3%, respectively (P = .04) at the 72-h time point, 39.6% and 31.6% (P = .06) at end of treatment, and 26.8% and 20.5% (P = .11) at the test-of-cure visit. The analyses demonstrated noninferiority for piperacillin-tazobactam at all time points (P< or = .0001). Treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam was independently associated with treatment success in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.64; P = .035). Both regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the noninferiority and safety of piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy, compared with cefepime, for the empirical treatment of high-risk febrile neutropenic patients with cancer.",exclude,,,,
25151488,Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of celecoxib for oral mucositis in patients receiving radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: Oral mucositis (OM) is a painful complication of radiation therapy (RT) for head and neck cancer (H&NC). OM can compromise nutrition, require opioid analgesics and hospitalization for pain control, and lead to treatment interruptions. Based on the role of inflammatory pathways in OM pathogenesis, we investigated effect of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition on severity and morbidity of OM. METHODS: In this double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 40 H&NC patients were randomized to daily use of 200 mg celecoxib or placebo, for the duration of RT. Clinical OM, normalcy of diet, pain scores, and analgesic use were assessed 2-3 times/week by blinded investigators during the 6-7 week RT period, using validated scales. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were randomized to each arm, which were similar with respect to tumor location, radiation dose, and concomitant chemotherapy. In both arms, mucositis and pain scores increased over course of RT. Intention-to-treat analyses demonstrated no significant difference in mean Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS) scores at 5000 cGy (primary endpoint). There was also no difference between the two arms in mean OMAS scores over the period of RT, mean worst pain scores, mean normalcy of diet scores, or mean daily opioid medication use in IV morphine equivalents. There were no adverse events attributed to celecoxib use. CONCLUSIONS: Daily use of a selective COX-2 inhibitor, during period of RT for H&NC, did not reduce the severity of clinical OM, pain, dietary compromise or use of opioid analgesics. These findings also have implications for celecoxib use in H&NC treatment regimens (NCT00698204).",exclude,,,,

Dexmedetomidine, a selective √é¬±2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has been reported previously to attenuate intrapulmonary shunt during one-lung ventilation (OLV) and to alleviate bronchoconstriction. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to determine whether dexmedetomidine improves oxygenation and lung mechanics in patients with moderate COPD during lung cancer surgery. DESIGN: A randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Single university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty patients scheduled for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery who had moderate COPD. Patients were randomly allocated to a control group or a Dex group (n√¢‚Ç¨≈†=√¢‚Ç¨≈†25 each). INTERVENTIONS: In the Dex group, dexmedetomidine was given as an initial loading dose of 1.0 √¢‚Ç¨≈†√é¬ºg √¢‚Ç¨≈†kg(-1) over 10√¢‚Ç¨≈† min followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 √¢‚Ç¨≈†√é¬ºg √¢‚Ç¨≈†kg(-1) √¢‚Ç¨≈†h(-1) during OLV while the control group was administered a comparable volume of 0.9% saline. Data were measured at 30 √¢‚Ç¨≈†min (DEX-30) and 60 √¢‚Ç¨≈†min (DEX-60) after dexmedetomidine or saline administration during OLV. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the effect of dexmedetomidine on oxygenation. The secondary outcome was the effect of dexmedetomidine administration on postoperative pulmonary complications. RESULTS: Patients in the Dex group had a significantly higher PaO2/FIO2 ratio (27.9√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†5.8 vs. 22.5√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†8.4 and 28.6√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†5.9 vs. 21.0√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†9.9 kPa, P√¢‚Ç¨≈†<√¢‚Ç¨≈†0.05), significantly lower dead space ventilation (19.2√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†8.5 vs. 24.1√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†8.1 and 19.6√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†6.7 vs. 25.3√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†7.8%, P√¢‚Ç¨≈†<√¢‚Ç¨≈†0.05) and higher dynamic compliance at DEX-30 and DEX-60 (P√¢‚Ç¨≈†=√¢‚Ç¨≈†0.0001 and P√¢‚Ç¨≈†=√¢‚Ç¨≈†0.0184) compared with the control group.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of intrathecal dexmedetomidine on spinal morphine analgesia in patients with refractory cancer pain. METHODS: A double-blinded crossover study was designed and performed. Patients were randomly allocated in one of the two phases. Phase M received intrathecal morphine administration. Phase M+D received intrathecal morphine plus dexmedetomidine administration. All patients were monitored for 7 days and crossed over to alternate phase for another 1-week observation. Daily average visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, pain frequency, sleep deprivation, daily morphine consumption, bolus dose injection times, and side effects were all recorded. RESULTS: Pain intensity and frequency were significantly decreased in both phases compared with baseline. Daily morphine consumption and bolus dose injection times during phase M+D were significantly decreased compared with phase M. The incidences of constipation were significantly reduced in both phases compared with baseline administration, but nausea and vomiting were significantly increased. No serious side effects such as respiratory inhibition were observed in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal administration of dexmedetomidine and morphine reduced the morphine consumption in patients with refractory cancer pain. There were no serious side effects.",exclude,,,,
28389324,Comparing the incidence of bone tumors in rats chronically exposed¬†to the selective PTH type 1 receptor agonist abaloparatide¬†or¬†PTH(1-34).,"Prolonged treatment with human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) in rats results in development of bone tumors, though this finding has not been supported by clinical experience. The PTH type 1 receptor agonist abaloparatide, selected for its bone anabolic activity, is under clinical development to treat postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. To determine the carcinogenic potential of abaloparatide, Fischer (F344) rats were administered SC daily abaloparatide at doses of 0, 10, 25, and 50¬†Œºg/kg or 30¬†Œºg/kg hPTH(1-34) as a positive control for up to 2 years. Robust increases in bone density were achieved at all abaloparatide doses and with hPTH(1-34). Comprehensive histopathological analysis reflected a comparable continuum of proliferative changes in bone, mostly osteosarcoma, in both abaloparatide and hPTH(1-34) treated rats. Comparing the effects of abaloparatide and hPTH(1-34) at the 25 and 30¬†Œºg/kg respective doses, representing similar exposure multiples to the human therapeutic doses, revealed similar osteosarcoma-associated mortality, tumor incidence, age at first occurrence, and metastatic potential. There were no increases in the incidence of non-bone tumors with abaloparatide compared to vehicle. Thus, near life-long treatment with abaloparatide in rats resulted in dose and time dependent formation of osteosarcomas, with a comparable response to hPTH(1-34) at similar exposure.",exclude,,,,
21044629,"Acycloguanosyl 5'-thymidyltriphosphate, a thymidine analogue prodrug activated by telomerase, reduces pancreatic tumor growth in mice.","BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gemcitabine is the standard of care for metastatic and nonresectable pancreatic tumors. Phase II and III trials have not demonstrated efficacy of recently developed reagents, compared with gemcitabine alone; new chemotherapic agents are needed. Ninety percent of pancreatic tumors have telomerase activity, and expression correlates with tumor stage. We developed a thymidine analogue prodrug, acycloguanosyl 5'-thymidyltriphosphate (ACV-TP-T), that is metabolized by telomerase and releases the active form of acyclovir. We investigated the antitumor efficacy of ACV-TP-T in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We evaluated proliferation and apoptosis of human pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1, MiaPaca2, BxPc3, PL45, and Su.86.86) incubated with ACV-TP-T. The presence of ACV-TP-T and its metabolite inside the cells were analyzed by mass spectrometry. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in nude mice carrying PANC-1 or MiaPaca2 pancreatic xenograft tumors. RESULTS: The prodrug of ACV-TP-T was actively metabolized inside pancreatic cancer cells into the activated form of acyclovir; proliferation was reduced, apoptosis was increased, and the cell cycle was altered in pancreatic cancer incubated with ACV-TP-T, compared with controls. Administration of ACV-TP-T to mice reduced growth, increased apoptosis, and reduced proliferation and vascularization of pancreatic xenograft tumors. CONCLUSIONS: ACV-TP-T, a thymidine analogue that is metabolized by telomerase and releases the active form of acyclovir, reduces proliferation and induces apoptosis of human pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro and pancreatic xenograft tumors in mice.",exclude,,,,
25890381,Albumin nanoparticles increase the anticancer efficacy of albendazole in ovarian cancer xenograft model.,"BACKGROUND: The poor prognosis of patients with drug resistant ovarian cancer and the lack of targeted therapy have raised the need for alternative treatments. Albendazole (ABZ) is an anti-parasite compound capable of impairing microtubule formation. We hypothesized that ABZ could be repurposed as a potential anti-angiogenic drug due to its potent inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in ovarian cancer with ascites. However, the poor aqueous solubility of ABZ limits its potential for cancer therapy. In this study, we have assembled ABZ with bovine serum albumin into nanoparticles with a size range of 7-10 nm (BSA-ABZ) and 200-250 nm (Nab-ABZ). We further examined the anticancer effects of ABZ carrying nanoparticles in ovarian cancer cells, in both in vitro and in vivo models. RESULTS: Drug release studies demonstrated that about 93% of ABZ was released from BSA-ABZ 10 nm in comparison to 83% from Nab-ABZ 200 nm at pH 7.4 in 8 days. In vitro cell proliferation studies showed that the BSA-ABZ 10 nm exhibited the highest killing efficacy of ovarian cancer cells with surprisingly least toxicity to healthy ovarian epithelial cells. Confocal microscopy and fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis (FACS) revealed more efficient internalization of the BSA-ABZ 10 nm by cancer cells. For in vivo studies, we examined the tumor growth, ascites formation and the expression of VEGF and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) in tumor samples and only VEGF in plasma samples. The BSA-ABZ 10 nm reduced the tumor burden significantly (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.02) at a much lower drug dose (10 Œºg/ml) compare to free drug. Both formulations were capable of suppressing the ascites volume significantly (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) and reducing the number of ascites cells. The expression of VEGF and SPARC was also reduced, which indicates the underlying therapeutic mechanism of the ABZ. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the BSA-ABZ may hold promise for the treatment and control of progression of ovarian cancer with ascites. However further studies are required to examine the efficacy of both the formulations in aggressive models of recurrent ovarian cancer with respect to particle size and dosing parameters.",exclude,,,,
27656712,Clinical picture of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and its differentiation from non-HIT thrombocytopenia.,"HIT is an acquired antibody-mediated disorder strongly associated with thrombosis, including microthrombosis secondary to disseminated intravascular dissemination (DIC). The clinical features of HIT are reviewed from the perspective of the 4Ts scoring system for HIT, which emphasises its characteristic timing of onset of thrombocytopenia. HIT antibodies recognize multimolecular complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin. However, a subset of HIT sera recognise PF4 bound to platelet chondroitin sulfate; these antibodies activate platelets in vitro and in vivo even in the absence of heparin, thus explaining: delayed-onset HIT (where HIT begins or worsens after stopping heparin); persisting HIT (where HIT takes several weeks to recover); spontaneous HIT syndrome (a disorder clinically and serologically resembling HIT but without proximate heparin exposure); and fondaparinux-associated HIT (four distinct syndromes featuring thrombocytopenia that begins or worsens during treatment with fondaparinux), with a new patient case presented with ongoing thrombocytopenia (and fatal haemorrhage) during treatment of HIT with fondaparinux, with fondaparinux-dependent platelet activation induced by patient serum (""fondaparinux cross-reactivity""). Ironically, despite existence of fondaparinux-associated HIT, this pentasaccharide anticoagulant is a frequent treatment for HIT (including one used by the author). HIT can be confused with other disorders, including those with a) timing similar to HIT (e.‚Äâg. abciximab-associated thrombocytopenia of delayed-onset); b) combined thrombocytopenia/thrombosis (e.‚Äâg. symmetrical peripheral gangrene secondary to acute DIC and shock liver); and c) both timing of onset and thrombosis (e.‚Äâg. warfarin-associated venous limb gangrene complicating cancer-associated DIC). By understanding clinical and pathophysiological similarities and differences between HIT and non-HIT mimicking disorders, the clinician is better able to make the correct diagnosis.",exclude,,,,

METHODS: 58 children with congenital heart diseases, including atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and atrioventricular septal defect, scheduled to undergo CPB, aged 4 - 72 months, were randomly divided into 4 groups: alprostadil Group P (n = 15) receiving alprostadil 10 ng/ml added into the prime solution and continuous pump infusion of alprostadil 10 ngxkg(-1)xmin(-1) via central vein until the end of operation, Group U (n = 15) receiving ulinastatin 20 000 U/kg divided into several doses to be added into the prime solution, Group PU (n = 14) receiving alprostadil and ulinastatin according to the above protocols, and Group C (control group, n = 14) receiving normal saline of the equal volume. Electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate (HR), pulse oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were continuously monitored during operation. Duration of mechanical ventilation and staying in ICU were also recorded. Plasma neutrophil (PMN), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9) levels in the radial arterial blood samples were measured after induction of anesthesia before CPB (T(1)), 30 minutes and (T(2)), 2 hours (T(3)), 6 hours (T(4)), and 24 hours (T(5)) after the declamping of aorta. Inhaled oxygen concentration and arterial blood gas analysis were recorded at T(1), T(2), and T(3) for calculation of oxygenation index (OI). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the MAP and HR among these four groups at any time points (all P > 0.05). The umbers of PMN and the levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha at T(2) and T(3) of Groups P, U, and PU were all significantly lower than that of Group C (all P < 0.05), with those of Group PU being the lowest. The IL-10 levels at T(2) and T(3) of Groups U and PU were significantly higher than that of Group C (both P < 0.05), the level of MMP-9 at T(2) and T(3) of Groups U and PU were significantly lower than that of Group C (all P < 0.05), however, there was not significant difference between Group P and Group C (P > 0.05). The OIs at T(2) of Groups P, U, and PU were significantly higher than that of Group C (all P < 0.05). The mechanical ventilation time of Groups P, U, and PU were all significantly shorter than that of Group C, and that of Group PU was significantly shorter than that of group C (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Decreasing the inflammatory response after CPB, alprostadil and ulinastatin used during CPB effectively reduce the pulmonary injury via inhibition of the neutrophil activation and cytokines release.",exclude,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of alvimopan to accelerate GI recovery after RC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in patients undergoing RC and receiving postoperative intravenous patient-controlled opioid analgesics. INTERVENTION: Oral alvimopan 12 mg (maximum: 15 inpatient doses) versus placebo. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The two-component primary end point was time to upper (first tolerance of solid food) and lower (first bowel movement) GI recovery (GI-2). Time to discharge order written, postoperative LOS, postoperative ileus (POI)-related morbidity, opioid consumption, and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated. An independent adjudication of cardiovascular AEs was performed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Patients were randomized to alvimopan (n=143) or placebo (n=137); 277 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. The alvimopan cohort experienced quicker GI-2 recovery (5.5 vs 6.8 d; hazard ratio: 1.8; p<0.0001), shorter mean LOS (7.4 vs 10.1 d; p=0.0051), and fewer episodes of POI-related morbidity (8.4% vs 29.1%; p<0.001). The incidence of opioid consumption and AEs or serious AEs (SAEs) was comparable except for POI, which was lower in the alvimopan group (AEs: 7% vs 26%; SAEs: 5% vs 20%, respectively). Cardiovascular AEs occurred in 8.4% (alvimopan) and 15.3% (placebo) of patients (p=0.09). Generalizability may be limited due to the exclusion of epidural analgesia and the inclusion of mostly high-volume centers utilizing open laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Alvimopan is a useful addition to a standardized care pathway in patients undergoing RC by accelerating GI recovery and shortening LOS, with a safety profile similar to placebo. PATIENT SUMMARY: This study examined the effects of alvimopan on bowel recovery in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. Patients receiving alvimopan experienced quicker bowel recovery and had a shorter hospital stay compared with those who received placebo, with comparable safety.

Patients (N = 518) receiving opioids for non-cancer pain were randomized to receive alvimopan .5 mg once daily, alvimopan .5 mg twice daily, or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients experiencing ‚â• 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs; bowel movements with no laxative use in the previous 24 hours) per week over the treatment period and an average increase from baseline of ‚â• 1 SBM per week. A significantly greater proportion of patients in the alvimopan .5 mg twice-daily group met the primary endpoint compared with placebo (72% versus 48%, P < .001). Treatment with alvimopan twice daily improved a number of other symptoms compared with placebo and reduced the requirement for rescue laxative use. The opioid-induced bowel dysfunction Symptoms Improvement Scale (SIS) responder rate was 40.4% in the alvimopan .5 mg twice daily group, versus 18.6% with placebo (P < .001). In general, alvimopan .5 mg once daily produced qualitatively similar but numerically smaller responses than twice-daily treatment. Active treatment did not increase the requirement for opioid medication or increase average pain intensity scores. Over the 12-week treatment period, alvimopan appeared to be well tolerated. PERSPECTIVE: These results demonstrate the potential for a PAM-OR antagonist to improve the symptoms of OIC without antagonizing opioid analgesia.",exclude,,,,
