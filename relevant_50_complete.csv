0,27989839,Cilostazol and enzymatically modified isoquercitrin attenuate experimental colitis and colon cancer in mice by inhibiting cell proliferation and inflammation.,"We previously reported the anti-inflammatory effects of cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 3, and two antioxidants, enzymatically modified isoquercitrin and  -lipoic acid in a dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis mouse model. We further examined the chemopreventive effects of these substances in a murine azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulphate -induced colorectal carcinoma model and compared the effects with those of the well-known anticancer natural plant pigment, anthocyanin. In addition, the effects on cell proliferation activity were evaluated in colon cancer cell lines and mucosal epithelial cells in a model of acute dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis. Cilostazol and enzymatically modified isoquercitrin improved the outcome of azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulphate-induced colorectal cancer along with anthocyanin though inhibiting inflammation and cell proliferation, but the effect of  -lipoic acid was minimal. Inhibition of cell proliferation by cilostazol was confirmed in  vitro. In the acute dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis model, cilostazol and enzymatically modified isoquercitrin prevented the decrease in epithelial proliferative cells. These results indicate that cilostazol and enzymatically modified isoquercitrin first exhibited an anti-dextran sodium sulphate effect at the initial stage of colitis and then showed antitumour effects throughout subsequent inflammation-related cancer developmental stages.",include,cilostazol,colorectal cancer,In Vitro,Effective
1,26878064,Zinc Ionophore (Clioquinol) Inhibition of Human ZIP1-Deficient Prostate Tumor Growth in the Mouse Ectopic Xenograft Model: A Zinc Approach for the Efficacious Treatment of Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths in males. This is mainly due to the absence of an available efficacious chemotherapy despite decades of research in pursuit of effective treatment approaches. A plausible target for the treatment is the established clinical relationship that the zinc levels in the malignant cells are markedly decreased compared to the normal epithelium in virtually all cases of prostate cancer, and at all stages malignancy. The decrease in zinc results from the downregulation of the functional zinc uptake transporter, ZIP1; which occurs during early development of prostate malignancy. This is an essential requirement for the development of malignancy to prevent the cytotoxic/tumor-suppressor effects of increased zinc on the premalignant and malignant cells. Thus prostate cancer is a ZIP1-deficient malignancy. This relationship provides the basis for a treatment regimen that will facilitate the uptake and accumulation of zinc into the premalignant and malignant cells. In this report we employed a zinc ionophore (clioquinol) approach in the treatment of mice with human ZIP1-deficient prostate tumors (ectopic xenograft model). Clioquinol treatment resulted in 85%inhibition of tumor growth due to the cytotoxic effects of zinc. Coupled with additional results from earlier studies, the compelling evidence provides a plausible approach for the effective treatment of human prostate cancer; including primary site malignancy, hormone-resistant cancer, and metastasis. Additionally, this approach might be effective in preventing the development of malignancy in individuals suspected of presenting with early development of malignancy. Clinical trials are now required in leading to the potential for an efficacious zinc-treatment approach, which is urgently needed for the treatment of prostate cancer.",include,clioquinol,prostate cancer,In Vivo,Effective
2,20798593,Use of dabigatran etexilate to reduce breast cancer progression.,"Coagulation proteases and the generation of thrombin are increased in breast tumor epithelial and stromal cells. Since thrombin can modify tumor cell behavior directly through the activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs) or indirectly by generating fibrin matrices, the effect of dabigatran etexilate, a direct thrombin inhibitor, on breast cancer development was evaluated. Dabigatran inhibited invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells across Matrigel-coated membranes at concentrations that had no effect on the proliferation index of cultured tumor cells. In vivo evaluation of invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells in tracheal xenotransplants in nude mice orally administered dabigatran etexilate twice daily at a dose of 45 mg/kg over 4 weeks demonstrated less invasion of tumor cells through the tracheal wall compared to vehicle-treated mice. To evaluate the effect of dabigatran on the development of metastatic foci, 4T1 tumor cells were injected orthotopically in the mammary fat pads of syngeneic Balb/c mice. Dabigatran etexilate treatment exhibited evidence of antitumor activity with a 50% reduction in tumor volume at 4 weeks following orthotopic injection of 4T1 cells in syngeneic Balb/c mice with no weight loss in treated mice. Dabigatran etexilate reduced both 4T1 tumor cells in the blood and liver micrometastases by 50-60%. These results suggest that oral administration of the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran etexilate, inhibits both invasion and metastasis of malignant breast tumors, suggesting that it may be beneficial in not only preventing thrombotic events in cancer patients, but also as adjunct therapy to treat malignant tumors.",include,dabigatran etexilate,breast cancer,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
3,30685222,A study in a rat initiation-promotion bladder tumour model demonstrated no promoter/progressor potential of dapagliflozin.,"Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, is indicated to improve glycaemic control in adults of type 2 diabetes. In nonclinical studies, dapagliflozin was neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic. However, in some clinical studies, an increased incidence of bladder cancer was observed in the dapagliflozin group vs. the placebo. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine if dapagliflozin can act as a promoter in a 2-stage bladder cancer model in rats induced with N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN). Rats given BBN (100 or 400 mg/kg, po) twice weekly for 6 weeks in Phase 1 were assigned in Phase 2 to receive daily dose of vehicle, dapagliflozin (0.5 mg/kg, po) or uracil (positive control, 3% in diet) from weeks 8-34. All bladders were evaluated by histopathology. Verifying the validity of the model, uracil increased the incidence of bladder cancer, while dapagliflozin had no effect on the incidence or invasiveness of transitional cell carcinoma. The exposure of dapagliflozin at 0.5 mg/kg/day in rats was 7 times the clinical exposure at maximal therapeutic dose (10 mg). In conclusion, dapagliflozin does not act as promoter or progressor of bladder cancer in a validated bladder cancer model in rats.",include,dapagliflozin,bladder cancer,In Vivo,No effect
4,23074173,"The iron chelator, deferasirox, as a novel strategy for cancer treatment: oral activity against human lung tumor xenografts and molecular mechanism of action.","Deferasirox is an orally effective iron (Fe) chelator currently used for the treatment of iron-overload disease and has been implemented as an alternative to the gold standard chelator, desferrioxamine (DFO). Earlier studies demonstrated that DFO exhibits anticancer activity due to its ability to deplete cancer cells of iron. In this investigation, we examined the in vitro and in vivo activity of deferasirox against cells from human solid tumors. To date, there have been no studies to investigate the effect of deferasirox on these types of tumors in vivo. Deferasirox demonstrated similar activity at inhibiting proliferation of DMS-53 lung carcinoma and SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cell lines compared with DFO. Furthermore, deferasirox was generally similar or slightly more effective than DFO at mobilizing cellular (59)Fe and inhibiting iron uptake from human transferrin depending on the cell type. However, deferasirox potently inhibited DMS-53 xenograft growth in nude mice when given by oral gavage, with no marked alterations in normal tissue histology. To understand the antitumor activity of deferasirox, we investigated its effect on the expression of molecules that play key roles in metastasis, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. We demonstrated that deferasirox increased expression of the metastasis suppressor protein N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 and upregulated the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1) while decreasing cyclin D1 levels. Moreover, this agent increased the expression of apoptosis markers, including cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1. Collectively, we demonstrate that deferasirox is an orally effective antitumor agent against solid tumors.",include,deferasirox,lung carcinoma,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
5,15517894,High efficacy of docetaxel with and without androgen deprivation and estramustine in preclinical models of advanced prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: To assess the activity of docetaxel in combination with hormonal therapy in preclinical models of prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since prostate cancer has a predilection for the bone, we assessed the antitumor activity of docetaxel in in vivo models of both bone metastasis and localized prostate cancer, using MDA PCa 2b and PC3 cells in SCID mice. RESULTS: Dramatic antitumor efficacy was observed regardless of whether the tumor cells were implanted in the prostate or in the bone. Antitumor activity was also evident in both osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions. Reasoning that docetaxel efficacy might be enhanced if it were to be used earlier in the course of the disease, we studied the sequence of docetaxel and androgen ablation (part of standard treatment for early-stage prostate cancer) in the MDA PCa 2b xenograft model. The activity was similar whether docetaxel and androgen ablation were used alone, simultaneously, or in sequence, indicating a lack of synergism or antagonism. Finally, we studied the combination of docetaxel and estramustine on androgen-sensitive and androgen-independent cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Estramustine did not increase the activity of docetaxel in these models. CONCLUSION: These results provide a strong preclinical rationale for the clinical development of docetaxel for the treatment of both locally advanced and disseminated prostate cancer.",include,estramustine,prostate cancer,In Vitro/In Vivo,No effect
6,25550798,Effect of celecoxib combined with chemotherapy drug on malignant biological behaviors of gastric cancer.,"Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, has been reported to have antitumor effects. In some tumor models, the combination of celecoxib with chemotherapy agents has shown synergistic antitumor effect; however, the effect of celecoxib combination with tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium on the malignant biological behaviors of gastric cancer in nude mice is unclear. In this study, female nude mice were subcutaneously transplanted with SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells. When the tumor model formed, the mice were divided into control group, celecoxib group, tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium group, and the combination of both drug regimens group. Mice were treated for 3 weeks. Following treatment, the proliferating index was calculated, apoptosis related proteins, COX-2, vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and lymphatic vessel density were quantified in tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining. The results revealed that celecoxib and tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium alone significantly inhibited tumor growth. The combination of these two drugs showed a synergistic antitumor effect. Both celecoxib and tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium alone inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis. The combination of these two drugs further enhanced this anticancer effect. Both celecoxib and the combination treatment inhibited lymphangiogenesis and the expression of COX-2 and VEGF-C. However, tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium treatment had no obvious effect on lymphangiogenesis. These results suggested that the combination of celecoxib and tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium produced a synergistic antitumor effect, possibly by inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells and promoting apoptosis. Celecoxib and celecoxib in combination with tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium possibly by reducing the expression of COX-2, in turn down-regulating the expression of VEGF-C, resulted in the inhibition of lymphangiogenesis.",include,celecoxib,gastric cancer,In Vivo,Effective
7,30414098,Mebendazole and radiation in combination increase survival through anticancer mechanisms in an intracranial rodent model of malignant meningioma.,"PURPOSE: Meningiomas are a frequent tumor of the central nervous system. Although mostly benign, approximately 5% present as atypical or malignant tumors. Treatments for atypical meningiomas include gross total resection and radiotherapy, but about 33% of patients have recurrent tumors, sometimes as a higher grade. Recently, the brain penetrant anthelmintic drug, mebendazole, has shown promise as an anticancer agent in rodent models of glioblastoma and medulloblastoma. METHODS: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) effect on colony formation, cell proliferation, and caspase-3/7 markers of apoptosis of mebendazole with and without radiation was measured in vitro. Mice intracranially implanted with KT21MG1 human meningioma were administered mebendazole alone or in combination with radiation. Survival benefit was evaluated, while tumors were investigated by immunohistochemical staining for apoptosis, cell proliferation, and vascular density. RESULTS: In vitro experiments on meningioma cell lines showed the IC<sub>50</sub> for mebendazole in the range of 0.26-0.42   M. Mebendazole alone induced cytotoxicity, however the combination had a greater reduction in colony formation and resulted in higher levels of cleaved caspase-3. The in vivo study showed both, mebendazole alone and the combination, to have a survival benefit with an increase in apoptosis, and decreases in tumor cell and vascular proliferation. CONCLUSION: These preclinical findings indicate that mebendazole alone or in combination with radiation can be considered for the treatment of malignant meningioma. The mechanism of action for this combination may include an increase in apoptosis, a reduction in proliferation and angiogenesis, or a combination of these effects.",include,mebendazole,meningioma,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
8,27470571,Candesartan attenuates angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma via downregulating AT1R/VEGF pathway.,"Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) was reported to express in many types of tumors, promoting tumor growth and angiogenesis. We herein examined AT1R expression in liver cancer and the potential antitumor effects of AT1R antagonist Candesartan in liver cancer. We found that AT1R expression was positively correlated with VEGF-A expression and microvascular density (MVD) in 40 HCC patients. Angiotensin II and Candesartan neither had effects on the proliferation of liver cancer cells in vitro. However, Angiotensin II upregulated AT1R protein expression and promoted production of VEGF-A in liver cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Candesartan was able to reverse this process in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Candesartan downregulated the expression of VEGF-A in SMMC-7721 bearing xenografts in mice and inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. Our data suggested that AT1R antagonist Candesartan might be useful to suppress liver cancer by inhibiting angiogenesis.",include,candesartan,liver cancer,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
9,22271897,The human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitor nelfinavir impairs proteasome activity and inhibits the proliferation of multiple myeloma cells in vitro and in vivo.,"BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is characterized by the accumulation of tumor plasma cells in the bone marrow. Despite therapeutic improvements brought by proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, myeloma remains an incurable disease. In a variety of human cancers, human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors (e.g. nelfinavir) effectively inhibit tumor progression, but their impact on myeloma is unknown. We assessed the in vitro and in vivo effects of nelfinavir on multiple myeloma. DESIGN AND METHODS: The effects of nelfinavir (1-10  M) on proteasome activity, proliferation and viability of myeloma cell lines and plasma cells from patients were assessed by measuring PERK, AKT, STAT3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and CHOP expression with immunoblotting or flow cytometry. The in vivo effect was assessed in NOD/SCID mice injected with luciferase expressing human myeloma cell lines and treated with nelfinavir at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day. Tumor progression was evaluated using a bioluminescent system. RESULTS: Nelfinavir inhibited 26S chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity, impaired proliferation and triggered apoptosis of the myeloma cell lines and fresh plasma cells. It activated the pro-apoptotic unfolded protein response pathway by inducing PERK phosphorylation and CHOP expression. Cell death triggered by nelfinavir treatment correlated with decreased phosphorylation of AKT, STAT3 and ERK1/2. Nelfinavir enhanced the anti-proliferative activity of bortezomib, dexamethasone and histone deacetylase inhibitors and delayed tumor growth in a myeloma mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that nelfinavir, used at a pharmacological dosage, alone or in combination, may be useful in the treatment of myeloma. Our data provide a preclinical basis for clinical trials using nelfinavir in patients with myeloma.",include,nelfinavir,multiple myeloma,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
10,27779705,Diphenhydramine induces melanoma cell apoptosis by suppressing STAT3/MCL-1 survival signaling and retards B16-F10 melanoma growth in vivo.,"Melanoma is the most aggressive skin malignancy with a high rate of mortality and is frequently refractory to many therapeutics, thus demanding the discovery of novel effective anti-melanoma agents. Diphenhydramine  (DPH) is an H1 histamine receptor antagonist and a relatively safe drug. Previous studies have revealed the in  vitro cytotoxicity of DPH against melanoma cells, but the mechanisms involved concerning its cytotoxicity and the in  vivo anti-melanoma effect remain unknown. We herein present the first evidence supporting that DPH is selectively proapoptotic for a panel of melanoma cell lines irrespective of BRAFV600E status while sparing normal melanocytes. Of note, DPH effectively suppressed tumor growth and prolonged the length of survival of mice bearing B16-F10 melanoma. Mechanistic investigation further revealed that DPH downregulated antiapoptotic MCL-1, whereas MCL-1 overexpression impeded the proapoptotic action of DPH. Moreover, DPH attenuated STAT3 activation, as evidenced by the reduced levels of tyrosine 705-phosphorylated STAT3. Notably, ectopic expression of constitutively active STAT3 mutant reduced DPH-induced apoptosis but also protected MCL-1 from downregulation by DPH, illustrating that DPH impairs STAT3 activation to block STAT3-mediated induction of MCL-1 in eliciting apoptosis. Collectively, we for the first time validate the in  vivo anti melanoma effect of DPH and also establish DPH as a drug targeting STAT3/MCL-1 survival signaling pathway to induce apoptosis. Our discovery therefore suggests the potential to repurpose DPH as an anti-melanoma therapeutic agent.",include,diphenhydramine,melanoma,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
11,29956761,Aclidinium bromide inhibits the growth and metastasis of gastric cancer MKN‚Äë28 cells via the PI3K signaling pathway.,"The present study investigated the effect and underling mechanisms of aclidinium bromide, a novel, inhaled long acting muscarinic antagonist, on the development of gastric cancer. Human gastric cancer MKN 28 cells, as a model in vitro, were treated with aclidinium bromide and dimethyl sulfoxide. Cell Counting Kit 8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry were used to assess cell proliferation, invasion/migration and apoptosis, respectively. In addition, western blotting was performed to determine the relative expression of proteins associated with apoptosis and the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Optical density values of MKN 28 cells were decreased in a time  and dose dependent manner in the aclidinium bromide treated group. Matrigel invasion analysis demonstrated the number of invasive cells were significantly decreased in the aclidinium bromide treated group when compared with the control group. Furthermore, aclidinium bromide led to the marked reduction of the number of MKN 28 cells passing though the microwells of the transwell chamber. The expression levels of the anti apoptotic protein B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl 2) decreased, and the expression of pro apoptotic proteins active Caspase3 and Bcl 2 associated X protein increased concurrently following aclidinium bromide stimulation using western blotting. The phosphorylation of protein kinase B and mechanistic target of rapamycin were significantly inhibited in MKN 28 cells treated with aclidinium bromide; and the activity of the downstream proteins such as p70S6K and Cyclin D1 were also significantly decreased. In conclusion, aclidinium bromide could inhibit gastric cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, which may be associated with the enhancement of apoptosis induced by the PI3K signaling pathway.",include,aclidinium bromide,gastric cancer,In Vitro,Effective
12,24412605,Hepatoblastoma cells express truncated neurokinin-1 receptor and can be growth inhibited by aprepitant in vitro and in vivo.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Multidrug resistance presents a major problem in hepatoblastoma (HB), and new anti-tumor strategies are desperately needed. The substance P (SP)/neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) complex has been discovered to be pivotal in the development of a variety of human cancers, and NK1R antagonists, such as the clinical drug aprepitant, are promising future anticancer agents. Yet, the role of the SP/NK1R complex as a potential anticancer target in HB is unknown. METHODS: Human HB cell lines HepT1, HepG2, and HuH6, human tumor samples from 17 children with HB as well as mice xenografted with human HB cell line HuH6 were analyzed regarding the SP/NK1R complex as a potential new anti-tumor target in HB. RESULTS: Therapeutic targeting with the NK1R antagonists aprepitant, L-733,060, and L-732,138 led to growth inhibition and apoptosis in HepT1, HepG2, and HuH6 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Intriguingly, HB cells predominantly expressed the truncated splice variant of NK1R. Human fibroblasts showed only dismal NK1R expression and were significantly more resistant. Stimulation of HB cells with SP, NK1R's natural ligand, caused increased growth rates and abrogated the anti-proliferative effect of NK1R antagonists. Expression analysis of 17 human HB samples confirmed the clinical relevance of NK1R. Most importantly, oral treatment of a HuH6 xenograft mouse model with 80mg/kg/day aprepitant for 24days resulted in a striking reduction of tumor growth, as evidenced by reduced tumor volume and weight, lowered tumor-specific alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) serum levels, and decreased number of Ki-67 positive cells. Furthermore, aprepitant treatment inhibited in vivo angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we describe the NK1R in its truncated splice variant as a potent target in human HB and an inhibitory effect in vivo and in vitro by NK1R antagonists. Therefore, NK1R antagonists should be considered promising new candidates for innovative therapeutic strategies against HB.",include,aprepitant,hepatoblastoma,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
13,25666502,Low Concentration of Caffeine Inhibits the Progression of the Hepatocellular Carcinoma via Akt Signaling Pathway.,"Accumulating evidences have reported that caffeine has anticancer effects at high blood concentrations. However, whether caffeine has anticancer effects on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells at low concentration, especially at physiologically applicable concentration (< 412  M) is still not well understood. In this study, HCC cell lines HepG2 and Huh7 were used. The cells were incubated with varying concentrations of caffeine (0, 50, 100, 200, 400 or 600  M). MTT assay was used to investigate the proliferation ability in vitro. Migration and invasion abilities were determined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. The molecular changes were detected by western blot. An ectopic nude mice model which the mice were gavaged with caffeine was used to reveal the anticancer effects of caffeine on HepG2 cells in vivo. Results showed that caffeine could inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion significantly at physiologically applicable concentration in vitro. Also the associated molecular changes of cancer progression were observed. In animal experiment, the mice gavaged with caffeine also performanced reduced tumor burden in vivo. Moreover, the interrelated protein expression was also observed in vivo which was coincident with the results in vitro. All in all, this observation indicated that caffeine may suppress the progression of HCC through Akt signaling pathway. This makes caffeine a potential candidate for treating HCC which will be a safer and more effective treatment by giving for a long time at physiologically applicable concentration.",include,caffeine,hepatocellular carcinoma,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
14,12231542,Mebendazole elicits a potent antitumor effect on human cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo.,"We have found that mebendazole (MZ), a derivative of benzimidazole, induces a dose- and time-dependent apoptotic response in human lung cancer cell lines. In this study, MZ arrested cells at the G(2)-M phase before the onset of apoptosis, as detected by using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. MZ treatment also resulted in mitochondrial cytochrome c release, followed by apoptotic cell death. Additionally, MZ appeared to be a potent inhibitor of tumor cell growth with little toxicity to normal WI38 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. When administered p.o. to nu/nu mice, MZ strongly inhibited the growth of human tumor xenografts and significantly reduced the number and size of tumors in an experimental model of lung metastasis. In assessing angiogenesis, we found significantly reduced vessel densities in MZ-treated mice compared with those in control mice.

15,14871995,Phenylbutyrate and phenylacetate induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation of human medulloblastoma cells.,"PURPOSE: Phenylbutyrate (PB) and phenylacetate (PA) have antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effects in malignant tumors, and had been evaluated in Phase I/II clinical trials. This study was undertaken to evaluate their antitumor activities in medulloblastomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The biological effects of PB and PA, ranging from 0.1 mM to 3 mM, on two medulloblastoma cell lines (DAOY and D283-MED) were examined using various long-term in vitro and in vivo assays for morphology, proliferation, differentiation, anchorage-independent growth, apoptosis, and tumorigenicity. RESULTS: PB and PA can both induce morphological changes and suppress proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These effects were more pronounced with PB and became irreversible in D283-MED cells after continuous exposure to 3 mM PB for 28 days. Both PB and PA were able to increase expression of glial marker glial fibriliary acidic protein and neuronal marker synaptophysin in two cell lines. For anchorage-independent growth, PB showed a more significant suppression than PA in D283-MED cells. PB caused more pronounced cell cycle arrest and remarkably reduced tumorigenicity in D283-MED cells than in DAOY cells. Apoptosis was readily induced in D283-MED cells with either low dose of PB or short-term treatment. In contrast, much higher concentrations of PB or longer treatment were required to achieve similar effect with DAOY cells. PB induced increased histones H3 acetylation in both cell lines, but histone H4 acetylation was only observed in D283-MED cells. CONCLUSIONS: PB, through induction of hyperacetylation of histone H3 and H4, is a much more potent antitumor agent than PA. 283-MED cells are more responsive to PB than DAOY cells, which may be dependent on their original state of differentiation as well as the changes of histone H4 acetylation status.",include,phenylbutyrate,medulloblastoma,In Vitro,Effective

All chemopreventive treatments began 2-wk post-carcinogen treatment and continued daily for 20 wk. Budesonide was administered by the aerosol route using an improved aerosol delivery system. Pioglitazone was introduced by oral gavage. The characterization of drug distribution showed that budesonide introduced by aerosol delivery accumulated only in the lung. Budesonide alone reduced tumor load by 78% and pioglitazone alone reduced tumor load by 63%. By combining aerosolized budesonide with pioglitazone, the inhibition on tumor load was 90%. In vitro experiments using human cancer cells showed that budesonide and pioglitazone exhibited independent, additive inhibitory effects on cell growth. Our results provide evidence that aerosolized budesonide and oral pioglitazone could be a promising drug combination for lung cancer chemoprevention.",include,budesonide,lung cancer,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
17,25446664,Metformin inhibits ovarian cancer growth and increases sensitivity to paclitaxel in mouse models.,"OBJECTIVE: There is increasing preclinical evidence indicating that metformin, a medication commonly used for type 2 diabetes mellitus, may protect against cancer. Motivated by this emerging evidence we asked 2 questions: (1) can metformin prevent ovarian cancer growth by altering metabolism and (2) will metformin increase sensitivity to chemotherapy. STUDY DESIGN: The effect of metformin in ovarian cancer was tested in vitro and with 2 different mouse models. In vitro, cell lines (n = 6) were treated with metformin (10-40 mmol/L) or phosphate-buffered saline solution and cellular proliferation and metabolic alterations (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activity, glycolysis, and lipid synthesis) were compared between the 2 groups. In mouse models, a prevention study was performed by treating mice with metformin (250 mg/kg/d intraperitoneally) or placebo for 2 weeks followed by intraperitoneal injection of the SKOV3ip1 human ovarian cancer cell line, and the mean number of tumor implants in each treatment group was compared. In a treatment study, the LSL-K-ras(G12D/+)/PTEN(floxP/floxP) genetic mouse model of ovarian cancer was used. Mice were treated with placebo, paclitaxel (3 mg/kg/wk intraperitoneally for 7 weeks), metformin (100 mg/kg/d in water for 7 weeks), or paclitaxel plus metformin, and tumor volume was compared among treatment groups. RESULTS: In vitro, metformin decreased proliferation of ovarian cancer cell lines and induced cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis. Further analysis showed that metformin altered several aspects of metabolism including adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activity, glycolysis, and lipid synthesis. In the prevention mouse model, mice that were pretreated with metformin had 60% fewer tumor implants compared with controls (P < .005). In the treatment study, mice that were treated with paclitaxel plus metformin had a 60% reduction in tumor weight compared with controls (P = .02), which is a level of tumor reduction greater than that resulting from either paclitaxel or metformin alone. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, we conclude that metformin alters metabolism in ovarian cancer cells, prevents tumor growth, and increases sensitivity to chemotherapy in vitro and in mouse models. These preclinical findings suggest that metformin warrants further investigation for use as an ovarian cancer therapeutic.",include,metformin,ovarian cancer,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective

Metformin is an orally taken hypoglycemic agent, which is extensively applied in the clinic. Clinical trials find that there may be a certain degree of action of the metformin in inhibiting malignant tumors. This paper aims to investigate the inhibitory effect and mechanism of metformin on human ovarian cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through in vitro cell experiment, the influences of metformin on the proliferation, colony formation and apoptosis of ovarian carcinoma cells were studied. Ovarian cancer cells SKOV-3 and A2780 in logarithmic growth phase were selected and cell proliferation was measured by MTT method. The metformin was processed for 48 h to calculate the survival rate of cells. Also, metformin was processed for 24 h and two weeks or stained with crystal violet, after which Quantity One (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) method was used to quantitatively analyze the cell clone formation, meanwhile, the FCM (flow cytometry) was used for the detection and analysis. RESULTS: Intervened by metformin with different concentrations for 48 h, the cell viabilities of SKOV-3 and A2780 cells were respectively reduced by 19.49   2.92%, 45.41   7.95%, 53.84   5.53%, 64.04   4.36% and 11.45   3.12%, 35.42   7.55%, 43.77   5.77%, 53.05   5.55% as compared with that in the control group with statistical significances. After processed by metformin with different concentrations for two weeks, the cells clone numbers of SKOV-3 and A2780 were significantly reduced. Treatment of metformin on SKOV-3 and A2780 cells of human ovarian cancer showed significant apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The metformin has the inhibitory effect on the cells of human ovarian cancer, which may be through inducing ovarian cancer cell apoptosis.",include,metformin,ovarian cancer,In Vitro,Effective

Breast cancer has been estimated as one of the most commonly diagnosed types of cancer among women. In particular, triple-negative breast cancers are associated with poor prognosis and metastatic growth. In the present study, we synthesized a novel metformin derivative 5 (HL010183) and metformin salts, 9a, 9b, and 9c (metformin gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) salt, metformin pregabalin salt and metformin gabapentin salt), which exerted more potent inhibitory effects on the proliferation and invasiveness of Hs578T triple-negative breast carcinoma cells than metformin. Importantly, 5 showed approximately 100-fold more potent effects compared to metformin. In a triple-negative breast cancer xenograft model, 5 showed a comparable degree of inhibitory effect on in vivo tumor growth at the 100mg/kg dose to that of metformin at 500 mg/kg. Our results clearly demonstrate that 5 exerts a potent anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in vivo, paving the way for a strategy for treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.",include,metformin,breast cancer,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
20,24327721,Naproxen induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in human urinary bladder cancer cell lines and chemically induced cancers by targeting PI3K.,"Naproxen [(S)-6-methoxy- -methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid] is a potent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 and is widely used as an over-the-counter medication. Naproxen exhibits analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Naproxen, as well as other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has been reported to be effective in the prevention of urinary bladder cancer in rodents. However, potential targets other than the COX isozymes have not been reported. We examined potential additional targets in urinary bladder cancer cells and in rat bladder cancers. Computer kinase profiling results suggested that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a potential target for naproxen. In vitro kinase assay data revealed that naproxen interacts with PI3K and inhibits its kinase activity. Pull-down binding assay data confirmed that PI3K directly binds with naproxen in vitro and ex vivo. Western blot data showed that naproxen decreased phosphorylation of Akt, and subsequently decreased Akt signaling in UM-UC-5 and UM-UC-14 urinary bladder cancer cells. Furthermore, naproxen suppressed anchorage-independent cell growth and decreased cell viability by targeting PI3K in both cell lines. Naproxen caused an accumulation of cells at the G1 phase mediated through cyclin-dependent kinase 4, cyclin D1, and p21. Moreover, naproxen induced significant apoptosis, accompanied with increased levels of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7, and PARP in both cell types. Naproxen-induced cell death was mainly because of apoptosis in which a prominent downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax were involved. Naproxen also caused apoptosis and inhibited Akt phosphorylation in rat urinary bladder cancers induced by N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine.",include,naproxen,bladder cancer,In Vitro/In Vivo,Effective
21,10411103,"Inhibitory effects of roxithromycin on tumor angiogenesis, growth and metastasis of mouse B16 melanoma cells.","We examined the effects of roxithromycin, a 14-membered ring macrolide antibiotic, on tumor angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis of mouse B16BL6 melanoma cells. The inhibitory effect of roxithromycin on angiogenesis using mouse dorsal air sac model was dose-dependent, and 100 mg/kg of roxithromycin administered intraperitoneally twice a day reduced the dense capillary network area to about 20% of the control. Administration of roxithromycin histologically reduced the development of microvessels and mononuclear cell infiltration. In vivo tumor growth studies demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of roxithromycin at 20 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day reduced tumor size of B16BL6 melanoma to about 56% and 33% (experiment 1), 71% and 48% (experiment 2) of that in the respective controls. Roxithromycin also significantly inhibited pulmonary metastasis of B16BL6 cells in a spontaneous system. The inhibitory activities of roxithromycin on angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis were compared with those of a potent angiogenesis inhibitor, TNP-470. These data demonstrated that roxithromycin has potent antiangiogenic and antitumor effects and might have possible therapeutic applications.",include,roxithromycin,melanoma,In Vivo,Effective
