## Future Directions
>* color code the confidence values of network predictions 
>* hover over biomedical jargon for simplified definition (e.g. apoptosis --> cell death)
>* underline keywords to draw attention to themes that help inform the reader to answer the questions
>* integrate saved responses with mongo DB database
>* clean data better (e.g. filter out for artifacts and section titles like "BACKGROUND")
>* be able to handle more complex therapeutic association classification than just binary (e.g. effective, no effect, inconclusive, detrimental)
>* evaluate success of machine learning models with user input
>* spend more time on bonus problem using neural net / `tdidf`
